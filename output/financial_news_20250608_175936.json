  "content": "BEIJING — U.S.-China trade talks “are a bit stalled,” requiring the two countries’ leaders to speak directly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent . “I believe that we will be having more talks with them in the next few weeks,” he said in the interview around 6 p.m. ET Thursday, adding that there may be a call between the two countries’ leaders “at some point.” After a rapid escalation in trade tensions last month, Bessent helped the world’s two largest economies reach a in Switzerland on May 12. The countries agreed to for 90 days, or until mid-August. Diplomatic officials from both sides had a . Still, the U.S. has pushed ahead with on Beijing, drawing its ire, while China has yet to significantly ease restrictions on rare earths, . “I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other,” Bessent said. “They have a very good relationship and I am confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President [Donald] Trump makes his [preferences] known.” Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping last spoke in January, just before the U.S. president was sworn in for his second term. While Trump has in recent weeks , analysts expect China to agree to that only if there’s certainty there will be no surprises from the U.S. during the call. China has maintained communication with the U.S. since the agreement in Switzerland, Chinese Ministry of Commerce Spokesperson He Yongqian told reporters at a regular briefing Thursday. But regarding chip export controls, she said that “China again urges the U.S. to immediately correct its wrong practices ... and together safeguard the consensus reached at high-level talks in Geneva.” That’s according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks. When asked whether China would suspend rare earths’ export controls announced in early April, He did not respond directly. Restrictions on items that could be used for both military and civilian use reflect international practice, as well as China’s position of “upholding world peace and regional stability,” she said. This week, the Trump administration also announced it would start . “The U.S. decision to revoke Chinese student visas is fully unjustified,” China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said Thursday, according to an official English transcript. “It uses ideology and national security as pretext.”",

  "title": "This is why Jamie Dimon is always so gloomy on the economy",
  "author": "",
  "published_date": "2025-05-30T17:05:05+0000",
  "content": "In this article The more worries, the better his bank seems to do. As has grown larger, more profitable and increasingly more crucial to the U.S. economy in recent years, its star CEO has grown more vocal about what could go wrong — all while things keep going right for his bank. In the best of times and in the worst of times, Dimon’s public outlook is grim. Whether it’s his 2022 forecast for a “ ” hitting the U.S. economy, his concerns over the fraying post-World War II world order or his about America getting hit by a one-two punch of recession and inflation, Dimon seems to lace every earnings report, TV appearance and investor event with another dire warning. “His track record of leading the bank is incredible,” said , a board member of four banks and investor through his firm Strategic Value Bank Partner. “His track record of making economic-calamity predictions, not as good.” Over his two decades running JPMorgan, Dimon, 69, has helped build a financial institution unlike any the world has seen. A sprawling giant in both Main Street banking and Wall Street high finance, Dimon’s bank is, in his own words, an end-game when it comes to money. It has more branches, deposits and online users than any peer and is a leading credit card and small business franchise. It has a top market share in both trading and investment banking, and more than $10 trillion moves over its global payment rails daily. A review of 20 years of Dimon’s annual investor and his public statements show a distinct evolution. He became CEO in 2006, and his first decade at the helm of JPMorgan was consumed by the U.S. housing bubble, the 2008 financial crisis and its long aftermath, including the acquisition of two failed rivals, and Washington Mutual. By the time he began his second decade leading JPMorgan, however, just as the legal hangover from the mortgage crisis began to fade, Dimon began seeing new storm clouds on the horizon. “There will be another crisis,” he wrote in his April 2015 CEO , musing on potential triggers and pointing out that recent gyrations in U.S. debt were a “warning shot” for markets. That passage marked the start of more frequent financial warnings from Dimon, including worries of a recession — which didn’t happen until the 2020 pandemic triggered a — as well as concerns around market meltdowns and the ballooning U.S. deficit. But it also marked a decade in which JPMorgan’s performance began lapping rivals. After leveling out at roughly $20 billion in annual profit for a few years, the sprawling machine that Dimon oversaw began to truly hit its stride. JPMorgan generated seven record annual profits from 2015 to 2024, over twice as many as in Dimon’s first decade as CEO. In that time, investors began aggressively bidding up JPMorgan’s shares, buying into the idea that it was a growth company in an otherwise boring sector. JPMorgan is now the world’s most valuable publicly traded financial firm and is spending $18 billion annually on technology, including , to stay that way. While Dimon seems perpetually worried about the economy and rising geopolitical turmoil, the U.S. keeps chugging along. That means unemployment and consumer spending has been more resilient than expected, allowing JPMorgan to churn out record profits. In 2022, Dimon told a roomful of professional investors to prepare for an economic storm: “Right now, it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,” Dimon said, referring to the Federal Reserve managing the post-pandemic economy. “That is right out there, down the road, coming our way,” he said. “This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,” Dimon said the following year in an earnings . But investors who listened to Dimon and made their portfolios more conservative would have missed out on the best two-year run for the in decades. “It’s an interesting contradiction, no doubt,” Mackovak said about Dimon’s downbeat remarks and his bank’s performance. “Part of it could just be the brand-building of Jamie Dimon,” the investor said. “Or having a win-win narrative where if something goes bad, you can say, ‘Oh, I called it,’ and if doesn’t, well your bank’s still chugging along.” According to the former president of a top five U.S. financial institution, bankers know that it’s wiser to broadcast caution than optimism. Former CEO Chuck Prince, for example, is best known for his ill-fated 2007 comment about the mortgage business that “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to .” “One learns that there’s a lot more downside to your reputation if you are overly optimistic and things go wrong,” said the former president, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss Dimon. “It’s damaging to your bank, and you look stupid, whereas the other way around, you just look like you’re being a very cautious, thoughtful banker.” Banking is ultimately a business of calculated risks, and its CEOs have to be attuned to the downside, to the possibility that they don’t get repaid on their loans, said banking analyst Mike Mayo of . “It’s the old cliche that a good banker carries an umbrella when the sun is shining; they’re always looking around the corner, always aware of what could go wrong,” Mayo said. But other longtime Dimon watchers see something else. Dimon has an “ulterior motive” for his public comments, according to Portales Partners analyst “I think this rhetoric is to keep his management team focused on future risks, whether they happen or not,” Peabody said. “With a high-performing, high-growth franchise, he’s trying to prevent them from becoming complacent, so I think he’s ingrained in their culture a constant war room-type atmosphere.” Dimon has no shortage of things to worry about these days, despite the fact that his bank generated a record $58.5 billion in profit last year. Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza rage on, the U.S. national debt grows, and President ’s trade policies continue to jolt adversaries and allies alike. “It’s fair to observe that he’s not omniscient and not everything he says comes true,” said Truist bank analyst . “He comes at it more from a perspective that you need to be prepared for X, as opposed to we’re convinced X is going to happen.” JPMorgan was better positioned for higher interest rates than most of its peers were in 2023, when rates surged and punished those who held low-yielding long-term bonds, Foran noted. “For many years, he said, ’Be prepared for the 10-year at 5%, and we all thought he was crazy, because it was like 1% at the time,” Foran said. “Turns out that being prepared was not a bad thing.” Perhaps the best explanation for Dimon’s dour outlook is that, no matter how big and powerful JPMorgan is, financial companies can be fragile. The history of finance is one of the rise and fall of institutions, sometimes when managers become complacent or greedy. In fact, the graveyard of bank logos that are no longer used includes three — Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and — that have been subsumed by JPMorgan. During his bank’s this month, Dimon pointed out that, in the past decade, JPMorgan has been one of the only firms to earn annual returns of more than 17%. “If you go back to the 10 years before that, OK, a lot of people earned over 17%,” Dimon . “Almost every single one went bankrupt. Hear what I just said?” “Almost every single major financial company in the world almost didn’t make it,” he said. “It’s a rough world out there.”",

Right now, the action is telling investors to stick to the shorter-end of the fixed-income market with their maturities. \"There's lots of concern and volatility, but on the short and middle end, we're seeing less volatility and stable yields,\" Joanna Gallegos, CEO and founder of bond ETF company BondBloxx, said on CNBC's The right now is paying above 4.3%, annualized. The is paying 3.9% while the is offering about 4.4%. ETF flows in 2025 show that it's the ultrashort opportunity that is attracting the most investors. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF ( ) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF ( ) are both among the top 10 ETFs in investor flows this year, taking in over $25 billion in assets. Only Vanguard Group's S&P 500 ETF ( ) has taken in more new money from investors this year than SGOV, according to ETFAction.com data. Vanguard's Short Term Bond ETF ( ) is not far behind, with over $4 billion in flows this year, placing within the top 20 among all ETFs in year-to-date flows. \"Long duration just doesn't work right now\" said Todd Sohn, senior ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities, on \"ETF Edge.\" It would seem that Warren Buffett agrees, with doubling its ownership of T-bills and now , according to a recent JPMorgan report. \"The volatility has been on the long end,\" Gallegos said. \"The has gone from negative to positive five times so far this year,\" she added. The bond volatility comes nine months after the Fed began cutting rates, amid concerns about the potential for resurgent inflation due to tariffs. Broader market concerns about , especially with a major tax cut bill on the horizon, have . Long-term treasuries and long-term corporate bonds have posted negative performance since September, which is very rare, according to Sohn. \"The only other time that's happened in modern times was during the Financial Crisis,\" he said. \"It is hard to argue against short-term duration bonds right now,\" he added. Sohn is advising clients to steer clear of anything with a duration of longer than seven years, which has a yield in the 4.1% range right now. Gallegos says she is concerned that amid the bond market volatility, investors aren't paying enough attention to fixed income as part of their portfolio mix. \"My fear is investors are not diversifying their portfolios with bonds today, and investors still have an equity addiction to concentrated broad-based indexes that are overweight certain tech names. They get used to these double-digit returns,\" she said. Volatility in the stock market has been high this year as well. The rose to record levels in February, before falling 20%, hitting a low in April, and then making back all of those losses more recently. While bonds are an important component of long-term investing to shield a portfolio from stock corrections, Sohn said now is also a time for investors to within their equity positions. \"International equities are contributing to portfolios like they haven't done in a decade\" he said. \"Last year was Japanese equities, this year it is European equities. Investors don't have to be loaded up on U.S. large cap growth right now,\" he said. The S&P 500 posted 20 percent-plus returns in both 2023 and 2024. The iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF ( ) is up 25% so far this year.  The iShares MSCI Japan ETF ( ) posted performance above 25% in the two-year period prior to 2025, and is up over 10% this year.",

  "content": "If you own mutual funds, can trigger a surprise — even when you haven't sold the underlying investment. But some lawmakers want to change that. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, this week , known as the Generate Retirement Ownership Through Long-Term Holding, or GROWTH, Act. If enacted, the bill would defer reinvested mutual fund taxes until investors sell their shares. Bipartisan House lawmakers in March. When you own mutual funds in a pre-tax 401(k) or individual retirement account, growth is tax-deferred. But if you hold assets in a brokerage account, distributions and dividends incur yearly taxes. Depending on performance, some mutual funds can spit off substantial gains during the fourth quarter. In 2024, some paid , Morningstar estimated. These payouts are subject to long-term capital gains taxes of 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your taxable income. Some higher earners also pay an on investment earnings. About $7 trillion of long-term mutual fund assets held could be impacted by the legislation, according to the Investment Company Institute, which represents the asset management industry. In a , Cornyn described the mutual fund proposal as a \"no-brainer\" that would \"help provide parity with other investment options.\" If enacted, the proposal would \"incentivize Americans to save and invest for their long-term goals\" without the stress of an \"unexpected tax bill,\" Eric Pan, president and CEO of the Investment Company Institute, following the bill's introduction. However, it's unclear whether the bill will advance amid competing priorities. Lawmakers are wrestling over President 's multi-trillion-dollar , which passed in the House on Thursday, and could face hurdles in the Senate. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has also asked Congress to before August to avert a government shutdown. While deferring yearly taxes could benefit some investors, you could also make portfolio changes, financial experts say. You can avoid mutual fund payouts by , or ETFs, which typically disburse less income, Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida, . Of course, the trade could also trigger taxes if the mutual fund has embedded gains, which may require some planning, he said. Alternatively, investors could opt to keep mutual funds in tax-deferred accounts, such as pre-tax 401(k)s or IRAs.",

Trump had announced on March 21 a plan to transfer more than 40 million student loan accounts to the SBA. “They’re all set for it,” the president said of the SBA at the time. “They’re waiting for it.” Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Education Department, slammed the judge’s decision. “Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,” Biedermann wrote in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

  "content": "Spending from foreign visitors to the U.S. is by $8.5 billion this year as negative perceptions tied to trade and immigration policy lead overseas tourists to look elsewhere, according to a research note published by Oxford Economics. The spending decline, which works out to a drop of about 5% relative to last year, is a result of less foot traffic. International arrivals to the U.S. are expected to fall about 9% this year, Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics, part of Oxford Economics, wrote in a research note last week. Businesses and geographies that rely on foreign tourists for commerce . Other estimates suggest the potential economic loss may be even larger. The World Travel & Tourism Council said this month it the U.S. economy to lose a “staggering” $12.5 billion in spending from international visitors in 2025, a “direct blow to the U.S. economy overall, impacting communities, jobs, and businesses from coast to coast.” Trump administration “posturing and policy” tied to issues like border security and tariffs on long-standing trade partners have created “sentiment-headwinds” among would-be travelers, Ryan wrote. Flight bookings to the U.S. between May and July were down 11% year over year as of April, signaling a “weak” outlook that’s likely attributable to travelers looking elsewhere, Ryan wrote. Europe and Canada are notable laggards: air bookings are pacing more than 10% and 33% behind, respectively. “Travelers make choices: where and when to travel, when to book, and how long to stay and importantly, perceptions of the US matter,” Ryan added. The U.S. Travel Association projects the U.S. will lose $21 billion in travel-related revenue in 2025 if current trends continue. Each 1% drop in spending from international visitors translates to $1.8 billion in lost revenue per year for the U.S. economy, to the trade group. A strong may also be deterring international visitors, experts said. While the dollar has weakened in recent weeks relative to other major currencies, it remains relatively strong, they said. That makes it more expensive for many foreign travelers, since it takes more of their money to buy U.S. goods and services. Experts have also pointed to potential fears tied to weaker growth prospects for the global economy. Some of those worries to trade barriers and uncertainty around trade policy. President has on several countries and products since his inauguration. Most recently, he on the European Union on Friday, only to two days later, to July 9. Travel expert points to tied to U.S. immigration policy as perhaps the most consequential development in recent months. “Whether fair or not, a perception is taking hold that more people are being detained, more devices [are] being searched and legal travelers [are] being deported back to their origin country,” Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, told CNBC earlier this month. “That creates a great deal of fear.” Heading into 2025, Oxford Economics had expected roughly 9% growth in international arrivals and a 16% boost to their spending. ,",

  "content": "It’s officially “ ” a term making the rounds on social media to sum up the chaos and high costs of May — which mimic those of December, minus the . Although May is typically a month of endings and new beginnings, and social pressure have helped drive up the prices for many of the expenses that fall within its 31 days. From graduation gifts and prom attire to camp payments, dance recitals and sports tournaments, the gauntlet of events has left parents feeling particularly strained. “May often feels like a second December because so many expenses pile up at once,” said Isabel Barrow, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. “Graduations, school events, weddings and summer travel plans all converge, creating a storm of financial stress.” Here’s a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business. The key is not to panic, Barrow said. “It’s important to remember that a long-term plan requires long-term perspective, and one month of overspending doesn’t have to derail your financial goals.” Most financial experts recommend going back to a basic . “The first step towards recovery is to take the time to review your spending and reassess your financial plan,” Barrow said. “Financial well-being begins with awareness and the feeling that you are regaining control.” If you’ve racked up , start addressing that immediately, Barrow said. To stay motivated, try picking a , such as the avalanche method or the snowball method, which respectively prioritize paying off the highest-interest debt first or paying off your debt from smallest to largest balance. At the same time, automating your is one of the best ways to rebuild after a heavy spending period, Barrow said: “Set up a recurring transfer to your emergency fund or savings account.” If your employer offers direct deposit splitting, use that to route a portion of your paycheck directly into savings, she advised. The start of summer is also a good time to scale back, according to certified financial planner Lazetta Rainey Braxton, founder and managing principal of the Real Wealth Coterie. Pack a picnic lunch for a day at the park, or “find free events such as museum days and public events.” There may also be more opportunities to pick up a side gig this time of year, she added, such as babysitting or tutoring over the long break from school. Those funds can help turbocharge debt repayment. “Know that Maycember is a stretch month that doesn’t represent the pace of your entire life,” said Braxton, who is a member of CNBC’s . “Use your experience as a guide with a rearview mirror.” Tally what you’ve spent on activities and celebrations such as Mother’s Day, graduations and vacations, as well as any payments towards camps or summer activities. Use that total to make a plan for next year, she advised. “Start a Maycember fund by creating a separate savings account and setting aside $25 a month or more,” she said. That advance planning can also come in handy to make the most of sales holidays later in the year, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, she added. Still, “It’s important to remember that you don’t need to overspend or go beyond your budget to give meaningful gifts,” cautioned Kelli Smith, a director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. “Thoughtfulness and creativity can make a big impact.”",

  "content": "Jamie Beaton has built a career helping students from around the world gain admission to and other top-tier institutions. Now, days after the banned Harvard from enrolling and stopped scheduling appointments for student visas, Beaton, co-founder and CEO of Crimson Education, a college consulting firm, is advising his clients to “ignore the chaos.” Getting into an Ivy League school like Harvard is a yearslong process, Beaton said. For recently admitted applicants, current students and this year’s graduating class, he says, “remain steadfast in that goal.” And for Harvard hopefuls, particularly from abroad, there could be a benefit to applying in the upcoming cycle even amid the ongoing political strife. “You may have an advantage in the eye of the storm,” Beaton said, as some applicants turn their attention to other schools. Over time, Harvard has become the of the Ivy League. As of last year, Harvard’s acceptance rate was just under 4%, down from more than 10% two decades ago. Roughly 18% of the Class of 2028 is from abroad. “I think Harvard’s brand on the world stage is so strong and so viral, it would take a long time to lose some of that trust and excitement,” Beaton said. “The brand can take a lot of big hits.” Of course, students are justifiably as the federal government continues to fire blows at one of the nation’s oldest and most venerable institutions of higher education. “It’s been a roller-coaster ride since last Thursday,” said Fangzhou Jiang, a student at Harvard’s and co-founder of Crimson Education. On Tuesday, the Trump administration moved to for international students seeking visas to come to the U.S. and said it plans to expand social media vetting of foreign students, effectively disrupting international enrollment. first reported the stop to new student visa interviews. In the escalating standoff between the federal government and Harvard, the White House also attempted to terminate Harvard’s student and exchange visitor program certification and cancel all remaining with Harvard, which are worth a reported $100 million. The latest moves come after Harvard a set of demands issued by the Trump administration’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism “The whole instability or uncertainty is quite damaging,” said Jiang, who has a student visa and would consider transferring across the country to Stanford University, where he is pursuing a dual degree. “It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Thursday. A federal judge in Massachusetts on Friday on international students, following a petition from Harvard. A hearing is set for Thursday, May 29, to determine whether the temporary order should be extended. “This is a critical step to protect the rights and opportunities of our international students and scholars, who are vital to the University’s mission and community,” Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, said in a . On its website, the says, “Harvard is committed to maintaining our ability to host our international students and scholars.” Beaton predicts that by the time college applications are due this fall, the university and the federal government “will come to a compromise.” “International students make up such a vital part of the undergraduate student population,” said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review’s editor-in-chief. Further, foreign students typically pay full tuition, which makes international enrollment an important source of revenue for Harvard and many colleges and universities in the U.S., according to Franek. Altogether, international student enrollment contributed to the U.S. economy in 2023-24, according to a report by NAFSA: Association of International Educators. During that academic year, the U.S. hosted a record number of students from abroad, marking a 7% increase from 2022-23, according to the latest data, released by the U.S. Department of State and the Institute of International Education.",

  "content": "Senate Republicans will soon debate approved by House lawmakers, including a for small business owners, contractors, freelancers and gig economy workers. Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Section 199A deduction for , or QBI, is currently worth up to 20% of eligible revenue, with some limitations. Without action from Congress, the QBI deduction will expire after 2025. But the House Republicans’ “ ” would make the provision permanent and expand the maximum tax break to 23% starting in 2026. The QBI deduction applies to so-called pass-through businesses, which report profits or losses on individual tax returns. This includes partnerships and S-corporations, along with some trusts and estates. Sole proprietors, such as freelance, contract and gig economy workers, also qualify. For 2025, the tax break starts to phase-out when taxable income reaches $197,300 for single filers and $394,600 for married taxpayers filing jointly. The deduction can be reduced or eliminated completely, depending on your earnings and type of business (more on that below). For tax year 2022, the most recent data available, there were roughly , up from 18.7 million in 2018, the first year of the tax break, according to IRS data. However, the deduction has been controversial because “most of the benefits flow to taxpayers with a lot of income,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy with the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy. “These are not taxpayers who work a W-2 job and earn a salary,” she said. “They’re business owners who receive business profits on their individual tax returns.” Currently, certain white-collar professionals — doctors, lawyers, accountants, financial advisors and others — known as a “specified service trade or business,” or SSTB, can’t claim the QBI deduction once income exceeds certain limits. There’s also an income phase-out for non-SSTB businesses, but that doesn’t go to zero. The House bill would change the phase-out calculation, which could provide a bigger tax break for certain SSTB owners, said certified financial planner and enrolled agent Ben Henry-Moreland, senior financial planning nerd for advisor platform Kitces.com, who last week. If enacted, the higher 23% deduction could offer “some [tax] benefit” for all income levels, but the phaseout changes would primarily benefit higher-income SSTB owners, he said. The House proposed QBI deduction changes would be “more generous and more valuable to higher-income people, especially those in certain industries including lawyers and lobbyists,” Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University Law, .",

As part of a at the nation's wealthiest and most elite Ivy League schools, President recently signaled that he would divert funds from Harvard to . \"I am considering taking THREE BILLION DOLLARS of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land,\" on Monday on Truth Social. It's unclear how the president's plan might work, and there would be associated with redirecting federal funding. But the president's comments underscore a changing perspective around alternative career pathways. In an interview on CNBC Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said, \"the paradigm, looking at education, is shifting.\" \"More adults, who are looking to upskill, are looking at different programs — two-year or short-term programs,\" McMahon said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"We believe there are other ways to train people to make a good living for their families in this country, and maybe not go into the debt of four-year universities.\"  and ballooning have played a large role in changing views about the higher education system. Overall, college enrollment is still climbing, but largely driven by gains at community colleges as more students choose shorter-term credentials at a lower cost. Undergraduate enrollment increased across the major institutional sectors this spring. However, community colleges notched the largest uptick, rising 5% year over year, according to a recent report by the . Undergraduate certificate program enrollment also jumped from a year ago, and is now up 20% since 2020. \"This is great news for community colleges, and especially for those with strong vocational programs,\" said Doug Shapiro, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center's executive director. \"Four-year colleges can also feel good about higher numbers of undergraduates this spring, but their growth rates are slower.\" Increasingly, high school students are questioning is worth it. Roughly 42% of high school students say they are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are planning to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or in-state public school, according to a separate survey of 1,000 seniors, juniors and sophomores by the . That's up from 37% last year. A shortage of , due to experienced workers aging out of the field, is also boosting the number of job opportunities and pay in those roles. \"Career programs at community colleges provide students with accessible, affordable and accredited credentials and certificates that lead to jobs in their local communities and in the global economy,\" said Walter Bumphus, president and CEO of the American Association of Community Colleges. \"In President Trump's first term we were able to partner with the U.S. Department of Labor to increase the number of apprenticeship programs and services across the nation, garnering 22,000 registered apprentices across 633 occupations, illustrating what is possible when we harness the power of partnering with the nation's community colleges,\" Bumphus said in an email. However, as lower-income students increasingly choose to attend community colleges or career training programs, there may be consequences for their longer-term financial standing, other reports show. Attending college once provided a similar wage premium for students regardless of their parents' financial standing, but that's changed in recent years, according to a by the National Bureau of Economic Research. As \"lower-income students have been disproportionately diverted into community and for-profit colleges,\" their return on investment has suffered, the report found: \"Higher-income students now derive greater average observational value from going to college than the lower-income students.\" In other words, despite efforts to improve college access, wealthier students, who are more likely to enroll in four-year schools, get a bigger payoff. Meanwhile, getting an Ivy League degree has a \"statistically insignificant impact\" on future earnings, according to a 2023 by Harvard University-based nonpartisan, nonprofit research group Opportunity Insights based on admissions data from several private and public colleges. Even attending a college in the \"Ivy-plus\" category — which typically includes other top schools like Stanford University, Duke University, the University of Chicago and Massachusetts Institute of Technology rather than a highly selective public institution, has benefits, the report found. It nearly doubles the chances of going on to an elite graduate school and triples the chances of working at a prestigious firm. Further, it increases students' chances of ultimately reaching the of the earnings distribution by 60%, the Opportunity Insights report found. \"Highly selective private colleges serve as gateways to the upper echelons of society,\" the group of Harvard and Brown University-based economists who authored the report said. \"Because these colleges currently admit students from high-income families at substantially higher rates than students from lower-income families with comparable academic credentials, they perpetuate privilege.\"",
