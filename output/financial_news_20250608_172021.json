Your property tax assessment is the way officials determine the value of your property for tax purposes. Inaccuracies about your home that factor into that formula could mean that you're overpaying. If it's inaccurate, you likely have most of the essential documents you need to appeal, as part of your recent home purchase, according to Sal Cataldo, a real estate lawyer and partner at O'Doherty & Cataldo in Sayville, New York. The title report, for instance, is going to tell you the age of the house, Cataldo said. You might have a home inspection report on hand that details the property's flaws, as well as an appraisal and your mortgage, which show the value of the house and the comparable value in the neighborhood. \"You've gotten a wealth of information about your house, whether you realize it or not,\" Cataldo said. A home sale will typically trigger a property tax reassessment because the property is changing hands, with the new market value applied to the assessment. But the specific rules of when the new value is applied and the frequency of reassessments will depend on your area. Here's why it may be valuable to add reviewing your property tax assessment to your to-do list as a newly minted homeowner: In addition to your , and costs, property taxes are another factor to consider as you assess your housing expenses. In recent years, property taxes have climbed because of rising home values and tax rates. The median property tax bill in the U.S. in 2024 was $3,500, up 2.8% from $3,349 in 2023, according to an report by Realtor. How much you pay varies widely depending on where you live, and some areas see higher bills and price hikes. As of 2023, the median property tax for homeowners in New York City was $9,937, LendingTree in a recent report. The city ranks first among the metropolitan areas with the highest median property taxes. Rounding out the top three are San Jose, California and San Francisco, where homeowners paid a median $9,554 and $8,156, respectively. It's not uncommon for properties to be over-assessed, meaning you end up paying more taxes than you should be, said Pete Sepp, president of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation: \"It pays to check.\" Sometimes it's because details in your assessment were never corrected over the years, such as an incorrect square footage of livable space or the amount of bathrooms that are actually in your home. NTUF 30% to 60% of taxable property in the U.S. is over-assessed, based on reports from individual state tax assessors. can lead to savings for several years as the change becomes the basis for the next assessment, said Sepp. While some state or local governments reassess annually, others have less-frequent cycles with gaps of several years. Some have no set schedule at all. Over 40% of homeowners across the U.S. could potentially save $100 or more per year by protesting their assessment value, with median savings of $539 a year, per Realtor.com .",

  "content": "Largely due to 's changing , have been on a rollercoaster ride since April. Although the has largely rebounded from last month's lows, some families who have been diligently saving for future college costs may still see their balance hasn't fully recovered. For those with , there are a few key considerations before tapping those accounts. \"With a little planning, making withdrawals can be something to celebrate, not just something to fear,\" said Smitha Walling, Head of Vanguard's Education Savings Group. Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business. For parents worried about their 529 account's recent performance, Mary Morris, CEO of Commonwealth Savers, advises starting with a look at the asset allocation. \"What you need to think about is assessing your risk appetite,\" she said. Generally, 529 plans offer age-based portfolios, which start off with more equity exposure early on in a child's life and then become more conservative as college nears. By the time high school graduation is around the corner, families likely have very little invested in stocks and more in investments like bonds and cash. but also mute gains. Pay attention to your fund's approach toward shifting from stocks to bonds, Morris said. \"If you are in a total stock portfolio, you may not want that ride,\" she said: \"You don't want to get seasick.\" If the market volatility is still too much to bear, consider adjusting your allocation. \"One strategy is to start de-risking a portion of their portfolio and reallocate a portion into cash equivalent, which will provide a protection of principle while also proving a competitive return and peace of mind,\" said Richard Polimeni, head of education savings at ‎Merrill Lynch. Still, financial experts strongly caution against shifting your entire 529 balance to cash. \"The worst thing an investor can do in a down market is panic and sell investments prematurely and lock in losses,\" Polimeni said. Often that is the last resort. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, only 10% of investors liquidated their entire 529 accounts, and 20% switched to less risky assets, according to an earlier by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. For those who must make a hefty withdrawal for tuition payments now due, \"consider whether it's better to use the funds now or let the funds continue to grow and those returns compound,\" said Vanguard's Walling. Polimeni suggests using income or savings outside the 529 to cover immediate college expenses, and requesting a reimbursement later to give the account a chance to recover from the recent market rout. from your 529 plan for any eligible out-of-pocket expenses within the same calendar year. \"Using that strategy gives another six to seven months for the market to recover,\" Polimeni said. Another option is to tap a federal student loan and take a qualified distribution from the 529 plan down the road. However, if you're thinking of taking out private student loans or a personal loan that starts incurring significant interest immediately, you may want to spend 529 funds first in that case, and . Once you have a withdrawal plan, you can — and should — keep contributing to your 529, experts say. Not only can you get a tax deduction or credit for contributions, but earnings will grow on a tax-advantaged basis, whether over 18 years or just a few. \"The major advantage is the tax-deferred growth, so the longer you are invested, the more tax-deferred growth you will have,\" Polimeni said. \"Markets go up and down, but students' goals remain the same,\" said Chris McGee, chair of the College Savings Foundation. Even as concerns over college costs are driving more would-be college students to rethink their plans, college savings accounts are still as vital as ever. Roughly 42% of students are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are opting to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or in-state public school, according to a recent survey of 1,000 high schoolers by the . That's up from 37% last year. As a result of those shifting education choices, 69% of students are expecting to live at home during their studies, the highest percentage in three years. Despite those adjustments, some recent have helped make 529 plans even more worthwhile: , families can roll over unused 529 funds to the account beneficiary's , without triggering income taxes or penalties, so long as they meet certain requirements. Restrictions have also loosened to allow 529 plan funds to be used for continuing education classes, and . For grandparents, there is also a new \" ,\" which allows them to fund a grandchild's college without impacting that student's financial aid eligibility. In part because of the new changes, more parents are utilizing a . In 2024, the number of 529 plan accounts increased to 17 million, up more than 3% percent from the year before, according to . Total investments in 529s rose to $525 billion as of December, up 11% from a year earlier, while the average 529 plan account balance hit a record of $30,961, data from the College Savings Plans Network, a network of state-administered college savings programs, also showed. The industry is coming off its best year ever in terms of new inflows,\" said Polimeni.",

  "content": "A federal judge’s recent order may foil  the country’s from the U.S. Department of Education to the . Judge Myong J. Joun of U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in his May 22 preliminary injunction that the Trump administration was required to reinstate more than 1,300 Education Department employees and was blocked from carrying out Trump’s directive “to transfer management of federal student loans and special education functions out of the Department.” In other words, federal student loans will stay with the Department of Education, for now. Trump had announced on March 21 a plan to transfer more than 40 million student loan accounts to the SBA. “They’re all set for it,” the president said of the SBA at the time. “They’re waiting for it.” Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Education Department, slammed the judge’s decision. “Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,” Biedermann wrote in a statement to CNBC on Thursday. The Trump administration the order be stayed pending an appeal of the decision. The development that student loans will remain in the Education Dept. for now is good news for borrowers, said Sarah Sattelmeyer, a project director at New America and senior advisor under the Biden administration. “Instead of increasing efficiency, the movement of the Department’s core functions would have increased confusion and decreased the effectiveness of programs that students depend on to access education,” Sattelmeyer said. Consumer advocates are worried that a mass transfer of accounts between federal agencies could trigger errors, or compromise federal student loan borrowers’ privacy. Those problems have occurred during much smaller transfers between loan servicers. Advocates also raise concerns about how a change in agency might affect borrower protections and programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Small Business Administration has no experience relevant to the management of federal student loans, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. It would ultimately require an act of Congress to move the loan portfolio to the SBA, Kantrowitz said. The Higher Education Act of 1965 spells out that the Education Department’s Federal Student Aid office is responsible for the debt, he said. Adding to advocates’ criticism over Trump’s proposed transfer was his administration’s in March that the SBA’s workforce would be reduced by 43% — leaving fewer people to manage this new responsibility.",

  "content": "Spending from foreign visitors to the U.S. is by $8.5 billion this year as negative perceptions tied to trade and immigration policy lead overseas tourists to look elsewhere, according to a research note published by Oxford Economics. The spending decline, which works out to a drop of about 5% relative to last year, is a result of less foot traffic. International arrivals to the U.S. are expected to fall about 9% this year, Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics, part of Oxford Economics, wrote in a research note last week. Businesses and geographies that rely on foreign tourists for commerce . Other estimates suggest the potential economic loss may be even larger. The World Travel & Tourism Council said this month it the U.S. economy to lose a “staggering” $12.5 billion in spending from international visitors in 2025, a “direct blow to the U.S. economy overall, impacting communities, jobs, and businesses from coast to coast.” Trump administration “posturing and policy” tied to issues like border security and tariffs on long-standing trade partners have created “sentiment-headwinds” among would-be travelers, Ryan wrote. Flight bookings to the U.S. between May and July were down 11% year over year as of April, signaling a “weak” outlook that’s likely attributable to travelers looking elsewhere, Ryan wrote. Europe and Canada are notable laggards: air bookings are pacing more than 10% and 33% behind, respectively. “Travelers make choices: where and when to travel, when to book, and how long to stay and importantly, perceptions of the US matter,” Ryan added. The U.S. Travel Association projects the U.S. will lose $21 billion in travel-related revenue in 2025 if current trends continue. Each 1% drop in spending from international visitors translates to $1.8 billion in lost revenue per year for the U.S. economy, to the trade group. A strong may also be deterring international visitors, experts said. While the dollar has weakened in recent weeks relative to other major currencies, it remains relatively strong, they said. That makes it more expensive for many foreign travelers, since it takes more of their money to buy U.S. goods and services. Experts have also pointed to potential fears tied to weaker growth prospects for the global economy. Some of those worries to trade barriers and uncertainty around trade policy. President has on several countries and products since his inauguration. Most recently, he on the European Union on Friday, only to two days later, to July 9. Travel expert points to tied to U.S. immigration policy as perhaps the most consequential development in recent months. “Whether fair or not, a perception is taking hold that more people are being detained, more devices [are] being searched and legal travelers [are] being deported back to their origin country,” Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, told CNBC earlier this month. “That creates a great deal of fear.” Heading into 2025, Oxford Economics had expected roughly 9% growth in international arrivals and a 16% boost to their spending. ,",

  "content": "It’s officially “ ” a term making the rounds on social media to sum up the chaos and high costs of May — which mimic those of December, minus the . Although May is typically a month of endings and new beginnings, and social pressure have helped drive up the prices for many of the expenses that fall within its 31 days. From graduation gifts and prom attire to camp payments, dance recitals and sports tournaments, the gauntlet of events has left parents feeling particularly strained. “May often feels like a second December because so many expenses pile up at once,” said Isabel Barrow, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. “Graduations, school events, weddings and summer travel plans all converge, creating a storm of financial stress.” Here’s a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business. The key is not to panic, Barrow said. “It’s important to remember that a long-term plan requires long-term perspective, and one month of overspending doesn’t have to derail your financial goals.” Most financial experts recommend going back to a basic . “The first step towards recovery is to take the time to review your spending and reassess your financial plan,” Barrow said. “Financial well-being begins with awareness and the feeling that you are regaining control.” If you’ve racked up , start addressing that immediately, Barrow said. To stay motivated, try picking a , such as the avalanche method or the snowball method, which respectively prioritize paying off the highest-interest debt first or paying off your debt from smallest to largest balance. At the same time, automating your is one of the best ways to rebuild after a heavy spending period, Barrow said: “Set up a recurring transfer to your emergency fund or savings account.” If your employer offers direct deposit splitting, use that to route a portion of your paycheck directly into savings, she advised. The start of summer is also a good time to scale back, according to certified financial planner Lazetta Rainey Braxton, founder and managing principal of the Real Wealth Coterie. Pack a picnic lunch for a day at the park, or “find free events such as museum days and public events.” There may also be more opportunities to pick up a side gig this time of year, she added, such as babysitting or tutoring over the long break from school. Those funds can help turbocharge debt repayment. “Know that Maycember is a stretch month that doesn’t represent the pace of your entire life,” said Braxton, who is a member of CNBC’s . “Use your experience as a guide with a rearview mirror.” Tally what you’ve spent on activities and celebrations such as Mother’s Day, graduations and vacations, as well as any payments towards camps or summer activities. Use that total to make a plan for next year, she advised. “Start a Maycember fund by creating a separate savings account and setting aside $25 a month or more,” she said. That advance planning can also come in handy to make the most of sales holidays later in the year, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, she added. Still, “It’s important to remember that you don’t need to overspend or go beyond your budget to give meaningful gifts,” cautioned Kelli Smith, a director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. “Thoughtfulness and creativity can make a big impact.”",

Now, days after the banned Harvard from enrolling and stopped scheduling appointments for student visas, Beaton, co-founder and CEO of Crimson Education, a college consulting firm, is advising his clients to “ignore the chaos.” Getting into an Ivy League school like Harvard is a yearslong process, Beaton said. For recently admitted applicants, current students and this year’s graduating class, he says, “remain steadfast in that goal.” And for Harvard hopefuls, particularly from abroad, there could be a benefit to applying in the upcoming cycle even amid the ongoing political strife. “You may have an advantage in the eye of the storm,” Beaton said, as some applicants turn their attention to other schools. Over time, Harvard has become the of the Ivy League. As of last year, Harvard’s acceptance rate was just under 4%, down from more than 10% two decades ago. Roughly 18% of the Class of 2028 is from abroad. “I think Harvard’s brand on the world stage is so strong and so viral, it would take a long time to lose some of that trust and excitement,” Beaton said. “The brand can take a lot of big hits.” Of course, students are justifiably as the federal government continues to fire blows at one of the nation’s oldest and most venerable institutions of higher education. “It’s been a roller-coaster ride since last Thursday,” said Fangzhou Jiang, a student at Harvard’s and co-founder of Crimson Education. On Tuesday, the Trump administration moved to for international students seeking visas to come to the U.S. and said it plans to expand social media vetting of foreign students, effectively disrupting international enrollment. first reported the stop to new student visa interviews. In the escalating standoff between the federal government and Harvard, the White House also attempted to terminate Harvard’s student and exchange visitor program certification and cancel all remaining with Harvard, which are worth a reported $100 million. The latest moves come after Harvard a set of demands issued by the Trump administration’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism “The whole instability or uncertainty is quite damaging,” said Jiang, who has a student visa and would consider transferring across the country to Stanford University, where he is pursuing a dual degree. “It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Thursday. A federal judge in Massachusetts on Friday on international students, following a petition from Harvard. A hearing is set for Thursday, May 29, to determine whether the temporary order should be extended. “This is a critical step to protect the rights and opportunities of our international students and scholars, who are vital to the University’s mission and community,” Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, said in a . On its website, the says, “Harvard is committed to maintaining our ability to host our international students and scholars.” Beaton predicts that by the time college applications are due this fall, the university and the federal government “will come to a compromise.” “International students make up such a vital part of the undergraduate student population,” said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review’s editor-in-chief. Further, foreign students typically pay full tuition, which makes international enrollment an important source of revenue for Harvard and many colleges and universities in the U.S., according to Franek. Altogether, international student enrollment contributed to the U.S. economy in 2023-24, according to a report by NAFSA: Association of International Educators. During that academic year, the U.S. hosted a record number of students from abroad, marking a 7% increase from 2022-23, according to the latest data, released by the U.S. Department of State and the Institute of International Education.",

  "content": "The Trump administration on Wednesday relaxed barriers in 401(k) plans to and related digital assets like NFTs and meme coins. The Labor Department put in place by the Biden-era Labor Department in 2022 that aimed to from such digital assets. At the time, the Biden labor officials employers to exercise “extreme care” before making crypto and related investments available to their workers. They cited “serious concerns” about the prudence of exposing investors’ retirement savings to crypto given “significant risks of fraud, theft, and loss.” The Trump Labor Department has withdrawn that guidance in full. The agency said the standard of “extreme care” cited by the Biden administration is not found in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. “Prior to the 2022 release, the Department had usually articulated a neutral approach to particular investment types and strategies,” the Trump Labor Department said in a compliance assistance bulletin issued Wednesday. The department said that it is “neither endorsing, nor disapproving of” employers who decide that adding crypto to a 401(k) investment list is appropriate. The Labor Department’s reasoning extends to cryptocurrencies and “a wide range” of digital assets like “tokens, coins, crypto assets, and any derivatives thereof,” it said. Knut Rostad, president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, an advocacy group, called the Trump administration’s move a “big mistake.” “As a huge general rule, crypto doesn’t belong in a 401(k), period, end of sentence,” he said. Rescinding the guidance “sends the wrong message by eliminating a yellow caution light and putting in place a green light” for employers and 401(k) investors to use crypto, Rostad said. The move comes at a time when President Trump has launched a that’s added to his net worth and led Democratic senators to an ethics probe. President Trump to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” Some observers will likely view the Labor Department move as an olive branch to the pro-crypto crowd, signaling to employers that they can add digital assets to their 401(k) lineups at will and without consequence, said Philip Chao, a certified financial planner and retirement plan investment consultant. “That may be the intended message,” said Chao, the founder of Experiential Wealth in Cabin John, Maryland. But he added, “I think it’s the wrong message.” ERISA bestows a fiduciary duty on employers and company officials overseeing their 401(k) investments. At a high level, that legal responsibility means employers must put the best interests of 401(k) investors first and act prudently when choosing which investments to offer (or not offer). That duty still exists — meaning it’s not a given employers will rush to offer crypto. Doing so might risk being sued by 401(k) investors in the future if their crypto investment goes belly up, Chao said. In this sense, the Labor Department’s move is “not necessarily controversial,” he said. “In reality, it’s saying we should treat crypto like any other asset,” Chao said. There was some pushback against the Biden-era guidance among retirement plan advisors at the time it was issued because it seemed to single out a specific asset class. However, he understands the rationale. “Crypto is such a new thing and there’s no regulation or protection, even a reasonable understanding of it,” Chao said. “And there still isn’t enough.” Stephen Hall, legal director and securities specialist at Better Markets, an advocacy group for financial reform, believes the Biden-era guidance likely saved millions of investors from “grievous losses” when crypto prices plunged during the “ ” of late 2022. “During that time, the of Do Kwon’s scam stablecoin project Terra Luna, and the of FTX, Celsius, Voyager Digital and BlockFi created a domino effect, sending crypto prices crashing and resulting in billions of dollars of customer funds frozen as courts sorted through the wreckage,” Hall said in an e-mailed statement.",

  "content": "In the between and the White House, could come out on top. As part of a at the nation's wealthiest and most elite Ivy League schools, President recently signaled that he would divert funds from Harvard to . \"I am considering taking THREE BILLION DOLLARS of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land,\" on Monday on Truth Social. It's unclear how the president's plan might work, and there would be associated with redirecting federal funding. But the president's comments underscore a changing perspective around alternative career pathways. In an interview on CNBC Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said, \"the paradigm, looking at education, is shifting.\" \"More adults, who are looking to upskill, are looking at different programs — two-year or short-term programs,\" McMahon said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"We believe there are other ways to train people to make a good living for their families in this country, and maybe not go into the debt of four-year universities.\"  and ballooning have played a large role in changing views about the higher education system. Overall, college enrollment is still climbing, but largely driven by gains at community colleges as more students choose shorter-term credentials at a lower cost. Undergraduate enrollment increased across the major institutional sectors this spring. However, community colleges notched the largest uptick, rising 5% year over year, according to a recent report by the . Undergraduate certificate program enrollment also jumped from a year ago, and is now up 20% since 2020. \"This is great news for community colleges, and especially for those with strong vocational programs,\" said Doug Shapiro, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center's executive director. \"Four-year colleges can also feel good about higher numbers of undergraduates this spring, but their growth rates are slower.\" Increasingly, high school students are questioning is worth it. Roughly 42% of high school students say they are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are planning to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or in-state public school, according to a separate survey of 1,000 seniors, juniors and sophomores by the . That's up from 37% last year. A shortage of , due to experienced workers aging out of the field, is also boosting the number of job opportunities and pay in those roles. \"Career programs at community colleges provide students with accessible, affordable and accredited credentials and certificates that lead to jobs in their local communities and in the global economy,\" said Walter Bumphus, president and CEO of the American Association of Community Colleges. \"In President Trump's first term we were able to partner with the U.S. Department of Labor to increase the number of apprenticeship programs and services across the nation, garnering 22,000 registered apprentices across 633 occupations, illustrating what is possible when we harness the power of partnering with the nation's community colleges,\" Bumphus said in an email. However, as lower-income students increasingly choose to attend community colleges or career training programs, there may be consequences for their longer-term financial standing, other reports show. Attending college once provided a similar wage premium for students regardless of their parents' financial standing, but that's changed in recent years, according to a by the National Bureau of Economic Research. As \"lower-income students have been disproportionately diverted into community and for-profit colleges,\" their return on investment has suffered, the report found: \"Higher-income students now derive greater average observational value from going to college than the lower-income students.\" In other words, despite efforts to improve college access, wealthier students, who are more likely to enroll in four-year schools, get a bigger payoff. Meanwhile, getting an Ivy League degree has a \"statistically insignificant impact\" on future earnings, according to a 2023 by Harvard University-based nonpartisan, nonprofit research group Opportunity Insights based on admissions data from several private and public colleges. Even attending a college in the \"Ivy-plus\" category — which typically includes other top schools like Stanford University, Duke University, the University of Chicago and Massachusetts Institute of Technology rather than a highly selective public institution, has benefits, the report found. It nearly doubles the chances of going on to an elite graduate school and triples the chances of working at a prestigious firm. Further, it increases students' chances of ultimately reaching the of the earnings distribution by 60%, the Opportunity Insights report found. \"Highly selective private colleges serve as gateways to the upper echelons of society,\" the group of Harvard and Brown University-based economists who authored the report said. \"Because these colleges currently admit students from high-income families at substantially higher rates than students from lower-income families with comparable academic credentials, they perpetuate privilege.\"",
