Your property tax assessment is the way officials determine the value of your property for tax purposes. Inaccuracies about your home that factor into that formula could mean that you’re overpaying. If it’s inaccurate, you likely have most of the essential documents you need to appeal, as part of your recent home purchase, according to Sal Cataldo, a real estate lawyer and partner at O’Doherty & Cataldo in Sayville, New York. The title report, for instance, is going to tell you the age of the house, Cataldo said. You might have a home inspection report on hand that details the property’s flaws, as well as an appraisal and your mortgage, which show the value of the house and the comparable value in the neighborhood. “You’ve gotten a wealth of information about your house, whether you realize it or not,” Cataldo said. A home sale will typically trigger a property tax reassessment because the property is changing hands, with the new market value applied to the assessment. But the specific rules of when the new value is applied and the frequency of reassessments will depend on your area. Here’s why it may be valuable to add reviewing your property tax assessment to your to-do list as a newly minted homeowner: In addition to your , and costs, property taxes are another factor to consider as you assess your housing expenses.

As of 2023, the median property tax for homeowners in New York City was $9,937, LendingTree in a recent report. The city ranks first among the metropolitan areas with the highest median property taxes. Rounding out the top three are San Jose, California and San Francisco, where homeowners paid a median $9,554 and $8,156, respectively. It’s not uncommon for properties to be over-assessed, meaning you end up paying more taxes than you should be, said Pete Sepp, president of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation: “It pays to check.” Sometimes it’s because details in your assessment were never corrected over the years, such as an incorrect square footage of livable space or the amount of bathrooms that are actually in your home.

If enacted, the bill would defer reinvested mutual fund taxes until investors sell their shares. Bipartisan House lawmakers in March. When you own mutual funds in a pre-tax 401(k) or individual retirement account, growth is tax-deferred. But if you hold assets in a brokerage account, distributions and dividends incur yearly taxes. Depending on performance, some mutual funds can spit off substantial gains during the fourth quarter. In 2024, some paid , Morningstar estimated.

Joun of U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in his May 22 preliminary injunction that the Trump administration was required to reinstate more than 1,300 Education Department employees and was blocked from carrying out Trump’s directive “to transfer management of federal student loans and special education functions out of the Department.” In other words, federal student loans will stay with the Department of Education, for now. Trump had announced on March 21 a plan to transfer more than 40 million student loan accounts to the SBA. “They’re all set for it,” the president said of the SBA at the time. “They’re waiting for it.” Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Education Department, slammed the judge’s decision. “Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,” Biedermann wrote in a statement to CNBC on Thursday. The Trump administration the order be stayed pending an appeal of the decision. The development that student loans will remain in the Education Dept. for now is good news for borrowers, said Sarah Sattelmeyer, a project director at New America and senior advisor under the Biden administration. “Instead of increasing efficiency, the movement of the Department’s core functions would have increased confusion and decreased the effectiveness of programs that students depend on to access education,” Sattelmeyer said. Consumer advocates are worried that a mass transfer of accounts between federal agencies could trigger errors, or compromise federal student loan borrowers’ privacy. Those problems have occurred during much smaller transfers between loan servicers. Advocates also raise concerns about how a change in agency might affect borrower protections and programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Small Business Administration has no experience relevant to the management of federal student loans, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. It would ultimately require an act of Congress to move the loan portfolio to the SBA, Kantrowitz said. The Higher Education Act of 1965 spells out that the Education Department’s Federal Student Aid office is responsible for the debt, he said. Adding to advocates’ criticism over Trump’s proposed transfer was his administration’s in March that the SBA’s workforce would be reduced by 43% — leaving fewer people to manage this new responsibility.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108120455-1742839719507-gettyimages-2206700478-_s016674_njcqjng0.jpeg?v=1742839763&w=1920&h=1080,2025-05-27T16:04:03+0000,2025-06-08T21:12:14.756826,neutral,CNBC,,"Breaking News: Politics,Donald J.

Although the has largely rebounded from last month’s lows, some families who have been diligently saving for future college costs may still see their balance hasn’t fully recovered. For those with , there are a few key considerations before tapping those accounts. “With a little planning, making withdrawals can be something to celebrate, not just something to fear,” said Smitha Walling, Head of Vanguard’s Education Savings Group. Here’s a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business. For parents worried about their 529 account’s recent performance, Mary Morris, CEO of Commonwealth Savers, advises starting with a look at the asset allocation. “What you need to think about is assessing your risk appetite,” she said. Generally, 529 plans offer age-based portfolios, which start off with more equity exposure early on in a child’s life and then become more conservative as college nears. By the time high school graduation is around the corner, families likely have very little invested in stocks and more in investments like bonds and cash. but also mute gains. Pay attention to your fund’s approach toward shifting from stocks to bonds, Morris said. “If you are in a total stock portfolio, you may not want that ride,” she said: “You don’t want to get seasick.” If the market volatility is still too much to bear, consider adjusting your allocation. “One strategy is to start de-risking a portion of their portfolio and reallocate a portion into cash equivalent, which will provide a protection of principle while also proving a competitive return and peace of mind,” said Richard Polimeni, head of education savings at ‎Merrill Lynch. Still, financial experts strongly caution against shifting your entire 529 balance to cash. “The worst thing an investor can do in a down market is panic and sell investments prematurely and lock in losses,” Polimeni said. Often that is the last resort. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, only 10% of investors liquidated their entire 529 accounts, and 20% switched to less risky assets, according to an earlier by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. For those who must make a hefty withdrawal for tuition payments now due, “consider whether it’s better to use the funds now or let the funds continue to grow and those returns compound,” said Vanguard’s Walling. Polimeni suggests using income or savings outside the 529 to cover immediate college expenses, and requesting a reimbursement later to give the account a chance to recover from the recent market rout. from your 529 plan for any eligible out-of-pocket expenses within the same calendar year. “Using that strategy gives another six to seven months for the market to recover,” Polimeni said. Another option is to tap a federal student loan and take a qualified distribution from the 529 plan down the road. However, if you’re thinking of taking out private student loans or a personal loan that starts incurring significant interest immediately, you may want to spend 529 funds first in that case, and . Once you have a withdrawal plan, you can — and should — keep contributing to your 529, experts say. Not only can you get a tax deduction or credit for contributions, but earnings will grow on a tax-advantaged basis, whether over 18 years or just a few. “The major advantage is the tax-deferred growth, so the longer you are invested, the more tax-deferred growth you will have,” Polimeni said. “Markets go up and down, but students’ goals remain the same,” said Chris McGee, chair of the College Savings Foundation. Even as concerns over college costs are driving more would-be college students to rethink their plans, college savings accounts are still as vital as ever. Roughly 42% of students are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are opting to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or in-state public school, according to a recent survey of 1,000 high schoolers by the . That’s up from 37% last year. As a result of those shifting education choices, 69% of students are expecting to live at home during their studies, the highest percentage in three years. Despite those adjustments, some recent have helped make 529 plans even more worthwhile: , families can roll over unused 529 funds to the account beneficiary’s , without triggering income taxes or penalties, so long as they meet certain requirements. Restrictions have also loosened to allow 529 plan funds to be used for continuing education classes, and . For grandparents, there is also a new “ ,” which allows them to fund a grandchild’s college without impacting that student’s financial aid eligibility. In part because of the new changes, more parents are utilizing a . In 2024, the number of 529 plan accounts increased to 17 million, up more than 3% percent from the year before, according to . Total investments in 529s rose to $525 billion as of December, up 11% from a year earlier, while the average 529 plan account balance hit a record of $30,961, data from the College Savings Plans Network, a network of state-administered college savings programs, also showed.

In the escalating standoff between the federal government and Harvard, the White House also attempted to terminate Harvard's student and exchange visitor program certification and cancel all remaining with Harvard, which are worth a reported $100 million. The latest moves come after Harvard a set of demands issued by the Trump administration's Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism ""The whole instability or uncertainty is quite damaging,"" said Jiang, who has a student visa and would consider transferring across the country to Stanford University, where he is pursuing a dual degree.

""International students make up such a vital part of the undergraduate student population,"" said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review's editor-in-chief. Further, foreign students typically pay full tuition, which makes international enrollment an important source of revenue for Harvard and many colleges and universities in the U.S., according to Franek. Altogether, international student enrollment contributed to the U.S. economy in 2023-24, according to a report by NAFSA: Association of International Educators. During that academic year, the U.S. hosted a record number of students from abroad, marking a 7% increase from 2022-23, according to the latest data, released by the U.S. Department of State and the Institute of International Education.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108150617-1748347893654-gettyimages-2217246172-vcg111570105011.jpeg?v=1748347996&w=1920&h=1080,2025-05-28T14:09:59+0000,2025-06-08T21:13:00.585983,neutral,CNBC,,"Harvard University,Student financial aid,Students,Politics,Breaking News: Politics,Higher education,Investment strategy,Breaking News: Investing,Personal finance,business news",CEO,"Harvard, Trump battle over international student enrollment may give some applicants a leg up, college expert says",http://api.scraperapi.com/?api_key=049f0bf1e28d549e626e40d6d8c4df6f&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F05%2F28%2Fharvard-trump-international-student-enrollment-battle-affects-college-applicants.html&follow_redirect=false&render=true&retry_404=true
58da848d106b82a254ba428f8814fb4d,,Finance,"Senate Republicans will soon debate approved by House lawmakers, including a for small business owners, contractors, freelancers and gig economy workers. Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Section 199A deduction for , or QBI, is currently worth up to 20% of eligible revenue, with some limitations. Without action from Congress, the QBI deduction will expire after 2025. But the House Republicans' "" "" would make the provision permanent and expand the maximum tax break to 23% starting in 2026. The QBI deduction applies to so-called pass-through businesses, which report profits or losses on individual tax returns. This includes partnerships and S-corporations, along with some trusts and estates. Sole proprietors, such as freelance, contract and gig economy workers, also qualify. For 2025, the tax break starts to phase-out when taxable income reaches $197,300 for single filers and $394,600 for married taxpayers filing jointly. The deduction can be reduced or eliminated completely, depending on your earnings and type of business (more on that below). For tax year 2022, the most recent data available, there were roughly , up from 18.7 million in 2018, the first year of the tax break, according to IRS data. However, the deduction has been controversial because ""most of the benefits flow to taxpayers with a lot of income,"" said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy with the Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy. ""These are not taxpayers who work a W-2 job and earn a salary,"" she said. ""They're business owners who receive business profits on their individual tax returns."" Currently, certain white-collar professionals — doctors, lawyers, accountants, financial advisors and others — known as a ""specified service trade or business,"" or SSTB, can't claim the QBI deduction once income exceeds certain limits. There's also an income phase-out for non-SSTB businesses, but that doesn't go to zero. The House bill would change the phase-out calculation, which could provide a bigger tax break for certain SSTB owners, said certified financial planner and enrolled agent Ben Henry-Moreland, senior financial planning nerd for advisor platform Kitces.com, who last week. If enacted, the higher 23% deduction could offer ""some [tax] benefit"" for all income levels, but the phaseout changes would primarily benefit higher-income SSTB owners, he said. The House proposed QBI deduction changes would be ""more generous and more valuable to higher-income people, especially those in certain industries including lawyers and lobbyists,"" Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University Law, .",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108072662-1733508707440-gettyimages-1746576755-2z6_1844.jpeg?v=1733508782&w=1920&h=1080,2025-05-29T10:00:01+0000,2025-06-08T21:13:39.427414,neutral,CNBC,,"Small business,Politics,Breaking News: Politics,Tax planning,Government taxation and revenue,Personal finance,Donald J.

a200e7f4913271ee4da7c850bc29fc06,,Finance,"In the between and the White House, could come out on top. As part of a at the nation’s wealthiest and most elite Ivy League schools, President recently signaled that he would divert funds from Harvard to . “I am considering taking THREE BILLION DOLLARS of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land,” on Monday on Truth Social. It’s unclear how the president’s plan might work, and there would be associated with redirecting federal funding. But the president’s comments underscore a changing perspective around alternative career pathways. In an interview on CNBC Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said, “the paradigm, looking at education, is shifting.” “More adults, who are looking to upskill, are looking at different programs — two-year or short-term programs,” McMahon said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “We believe there are other ways to train people to make a good living for their families in this country, and maybe not go into the debt of four-year universities.”  and ballooning have played a large role in changing views about the higher education system. Overall, college enrollment is still climbing, but largely driven by gains at community colleges as more students choose shorter-term credentials at a lower cost. Undergraduate enrollment increased across the major institutional sectors this spring. However, community colleges notched the largest uptick, rising 5% year over year, according to a recent report by the . Undergraduate certificate program enrollment also jumped from a year ago, and is now up 20% since 2020. “This is great news for community colleges, and especially for those with strong vocational programs,” said Doug Shapiro, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center’s executive director. “Four-year colleges can also feel good about higher numbers of undergraduates this spring, but their growth rates are slower.” Increasingly, high school students are questioning is worth it. Roughly 42% of high school students say they are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are planning to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or in-state public school, according to a separate survey of 1,000 seniors, juniors and sophomores by the . That’s up from 37% last year. A shortage of , due to experienced workers aging out of the field, is also boosting the number of job opportunities and pay in those roles. “Career programs at community colleges provide students with accessible, affordable and accredited credentials and certificates that lead to jobs in their local communities and in the global economy,” said Walter Bumphus, president and CEO of the American Association of Community Colleges. “In President Trump’s first term we were able to partner with the U.S. Department of Labor to increase the number of apprenticeship programs and services across the nation, garnering 22,000 registered apprentices across 633 occupations, illustrating what is possible when we harness the power of partnering with the nation’s community colleges,” Bumphus said in an email. However, as lower-income students increasingly choose to attend community colleges or career training programs, there may be consequences for their longer-term financial standing, other reports show. Attending college once provided a similar wage premium for students regardless of their parents’ financial standing, but that’s changed in recent years, according to a by the National Bureau of Economic Research. As “lower-income students have been disproportionately diverted into community and for-profit colleges,” their return on investment has suffered, the report found: “Higher-income students now derive greater average observational value from going to college than the lower-income students.” In other words, despite efforts to improve college access, wealthier students, who are more likely to enroll in four-year schools, get a bigger payoff. Meanwhile, getting an Ivy League degree has a “statistically insignificant impact” on future earnings, according to a 2023 by Harvard University-based nonpartisan, nonprofit research group Opportunity Insights based on admissions data from several private and public colleges. Even attending a college in the “Ivy-plus” category — which typically includes other top schools like Stanford University, Duke University, the University of Chicago and Massachusetts Institute of Technology rather than a highly selective public institution, has benefits, the report found. It nearly doubles the chances of going on to an elite graduate school and triples the chances of working at a prestigious firm. Further, it increases students’ chances of ultimately reaching the of the earnings distribution by 60%, the Opportunity Insights report found. “Highly selective private colleges serve as gateways to the upper echelons of society,” the group of Harvard and Brown University-based economists who authored the report said. “Because these colleges currently admit students from high-income families at substantially higher rates than students from lower-income families with comparable academic credentials, they perpetuate privilege.”",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108041573-1727799960171-gettyimages-723503307-is09b595q.jpeg?v=1748442645&w=1920&h=1080,2025-05-29T15:57:49+0000,2025-06-08T21:14:20.353502,neutral,CNBC,,"Harvard University,Vocational education,Politics,Breaking News: Politics,Careers,Higher education,Investment strategy,Breaking News: Investing,Donald Trump,Donald J.
