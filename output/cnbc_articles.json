Your property tax assessment is the way officials determine the value of your property for tax purposes. Inaccuracies about your home that factor into that formula could mean that you\u2019re overpaying. If it\u2019s inaccurate, you likely have most of the essential documents you need to appeal, as part of your recent home purchase, according to Sal Cataldo, a real estate lawyer and partner at O\u2019Doherty & Cataldo in Sayville, New York. The title report, for instance, is going to tell you the age of the house, Cataldo said. You might have a home inspection report on hand that details the property\u2019s flaws, as well as an appraisal and your mortgage, which show the value of the house and the comparable value in the neighborhood. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten a wealth of information about your house, whether you realize it or not,\u201d Cataldo said.

As of 2023, the median property tax for homeowners in New York City was $9,937, LendingTree in a recent report. The city ranks first among the metropolitan areas with the highest median property taxes. Rounding out the top three are San Jose, California and San Francisco, where homeowners paid a median $9,554 and $8,156, respectively. It\u2019s not uncommon for properties to be over-assessed, meaning you end up paying more taxes than you should be, said Pete Sepp, president of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation: \u201cIt pays to check.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s because details in your assessment were never corrected over the years, such as an incorrect square footage of livable space or the amount of bathrooms that are actually in your home.

Trump had announced on March 21 a plan to transfer more than 40 million student loan accounts to the SBA. \u201cThey\u2019re all set for it,\u201d the president said of the SBA at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for it.\u201d Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Education Department, slammed the judge\u2019s decision. \u201cOnce again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,\u201d Biedermann wrote in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

Consumer advocates are worried that a mass transfer of accounts between federal agencies could trigger errors, or compromise federal student loan borrowers\u2019 privacy. Those problems have occurred during much smaller transfers between loan servicers. Advocates also raise concerns about how a change in agency might affect borrower protections and programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Small Business Administration has no experience relevant to the management of federal student loans, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. It would ultimately require an act of Congress to move the loan portfolio to the SBA, Kantrowitz said. The Higher Education Act of 1965 spells out that the Education Department\u2019s Federal Student Aid office is responsible for the debt, he said.

Although the has largely rebounded from last month\u2019s lows, some families who have been diligently saving for future college costs may still see their balance hasn\u2019t fully recovered. For those with , there are a few key considerations before tapping those accounts. \u201cWith a little planning, making withdrawals can be something to celebrate, not just something to fear,\u201d said Smitha Walling, Head of\u00a0Vanguard\u2019s Education Savings Group. Here\u2019s a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business. For parents worried about their 529 account\u2019s recent performance, Mary Morris, CEO of\u00a0Commonwealth Savers, advises starting with a look at the asset allocation.\u00a0\u201cWhat you need to think about is assessing your risk appetite,\u201d she said. Generally, 529 plans offer age-based portfolios, which start off with more equity exposure early on in a child\u2019s life and then become more conservative as college nears. By the time high school graduation is around the corner, families likely have very little invested in stocks and more in investments like bonds and cash. but also mute gains. Pay attention to your fund\u2019s approach toward\u00a0shifting from stocks to bonds, Morris said. \u201cIf you are in a total stock portfolio, you may not want that ride,\u201d she said: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get seasick.\u201d If the market volatility is still too much to bear, consider adjusting your allocation. \u201cOne strategy is to start de-risking a portion of their portfolio and reallocate a portion into cash equivalent, which will provide a protection of principle while also proving a competitive return and peace of mind,\u201d said Richard Polimeni, head of education savings at \u200eMerrill\u00a0Lynch. Still, financial experts strongly caution against shifting your entire 529 balance to cash. \u201cThe worst thing an investor can do in a down market is panic and sell investments prematurely and lock in losses,\u201d Polimeni said. Often that is the last resort. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, only 10% of investors liquidated their entire 529 accounts, and 20% switched to less risky assets, according to an earlier by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. For those who must make a hefty withdrawal for tuition payments now due, \u201cconsider whether it\u2019s better to use the funds now or let the funds continue to grow and those returns compound,\u201d said Vanguard\u2019s Walling. Polimeni suggests using income or savings outside the 529 to cover immediate college expenses, and requesting a reimbursement later to give the account a chance to recover from the recent market rout. from your 529 plan for any eligible out-of-pocket expenses within the same calendar year. \u201cUsing that strategy gives another six to seven months for the market to recover,\u201d Polimeni said. Another option is to tap a federal student loan and take a qualified distribution from the 529 plan down the road. However, if you\u2019re thinking of taking out private student loans or a personal loan that starts incurring significant interest immediately, you may want to spend 529 funds first in that case, and . Once you have a withdrawal plan, you can \u2014 and should \u2014 keep contributing to your 529, experts say. Not only can you get a tax deduction or credit for contributions, but earnings will grow on a tax-advantaged basis, whether over 18 years or just a few. \u201cThe major advantage is the tax-deferred growth, so the longer you are invested, the more tax-deferred growth you will have,\u201d Polimeni said. \u201cMarkets go up and down, but students\u2019 goals remain the same,\u201d said Chris McGee, chair of the College Savings Foundation. Even as concerns over college costs are driving more would-be college students to rethink their plans, college savings accounts are still as vital as ever. Roughly 42% of students are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are opting to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or\u00a0in-state public school, according to a recent survey\u00a0of 1,000 high schoolers\u00a0by the . That\u2019s up from 37% last year. As a result of those shifting education choices, 69% of students are expecting to live at home during their studies, the highest percentage in three years. Despite those adjustments, some recent have helped make 529 plans even more worthwhile: , families can roll over unused\u00a0529\u00a0funds to the account beneficiary\u2019s , without triggering income taxes or penalties, so long as they meet certain requirements. Restrictions have also loosened to allow 529 plan funds to be used for continuing education classes, and . For grandparents, there is also a new \u201c ,\u201d which allows them to fund a grandchild\u2019s college without impacting that student\u2019s financial aid eligibility. In part because of the new changes, more parents are utilizing a . In 2024, the number of 529 plan accounts increased to 17 million, up more than 3% percent from the year before, according to . Total investments in 529s rose to $525 billion as of December, up 11% from a year earlier, while the average 529 plan account balance hit a record of $30,961, data from the\u00a0College Savings Plans Network, a network of state-administered college savings programs, also showed.

To stay motivated, try picking a , such as the avalanche method or the snowball method, which respectively prioritize paying off the highest-interest debt first or paying off your debt from smallest to largest balance. At the same time, automating your is one of the best ways to rebuild after a heavy spending period, Barrow said: \"Set up a recurring transfer to your emergency fund or savings account.\" If your employer offers direct deposit splitting, use that to route a portion of your paycheck directly into savings, she advised. The start of summer is also a good time to scale back, according to certified financial planner Lazetta Rainey Braxton, founder and managing principal of the Real Wealth Coterie. Pack a picnic lunch for a day at the park, or \"find free events such as museum days and public events.\" There may also be more opportunities to pick up a side gig this time of year, she added, such as babysitting or tutoring over the long break from school. Those funds can help turbocharge debt repayment. \"Know that Maycember is a stretch month that doesn't represent the pace of your entire life,\" said Braxton, who is a member of CNBC's . \"Use your experience as a guide with a rearview mirror.\" Tally what you've spent on activities and celebrations such as Mother's Day, graduations and vacations, as well as any payments towards camps or summer activities. Use that total to make a plan for next year, she advised. \"Start a Maycember fund by creating a separate savings account and setting aside $25 a month or more,\" she said. That advance planning can also come in handy to make the most of sales holidays later in the year, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, she added. Still, \"It's important to remember that you don't need to overspend or go beyond your budget to give meaningful gifts,\" cautioned Kelli Smith, a director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. \"Thoughtfulness and creativity can make a big impact.\"", "tags": ["Family finances", "Life", "Personal loans", "Personal saving", "Investment strategy", "Breaking News: Investing", "Financial consulting", "Personal finance", "business news"], "image_url": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106798817-1605710464022-gettyimages-633707459-bld183436.jpeg?v=1688753140&w=1920&h=1080", "scraped_date": "2025-06-08T21:12:40.586628", "article_id": "ba8ed9a103994133bbbeed3540815033", "category": "Finance", "ticker_symbols": ["CNBC"], "sentiment_score": "neutral"},

Now, days after the banned Harvard from enrolling and stopped scheduling appointments for student visas, Beaton, co-founder and CEO of\u00a0Crimson\u00a0Education, a college consulting firm, is advising his clients to \"ignore the chaos.\" Getting into an Ivy League school like Harvard is a yearslong process, Beaton said. For recently admitted applicants, current students and this year's graduating class, he says, \"remain steadfast in that goal.\" And for Harvard hopefuls, particularly from abroad, there could be a benefit to applying in the upcoming cycle even amid the ongoing political strife. \"You may have an advantage in the eye of the storm,\" Beaton said, as some applicants turn their attention to other schools. Over time, Harvard has become the of the Ivy League. As of last year, Harvard's\u00a0acceptance rate was just under 4%, down from more than 10% two decades ago. Roughly 18% of the Class of 2028 is from abroad. \"I think Harvard's brand on the world stage is so strong and so viral, it would take a long time to lose some of that trust and excitement,\" Beaton said. \"The brand can take a lot of big hits.\" Of course, students are justifiably as the federal government continues to fire blows at one of the nation's oldest and most venerable institutions of higher education. \"It's been a roller-coaster ride since last Thursday,\" said Fangzhou Jiang, a student at Harvard's and co-founder of Crimson Education. On Tuesday, the Trump administration\u00a0moved to for international students seeking visas to come to the U.S. and said it plans to expand social media vetting of foreign students, effectively disrupting international enrollment. first reported the stop to new student visa interviews. In the escalating standoff between the federal government and Harvard, the White House also attempted to terminate Harvard's student and exchange visitor program certification and cancel all remaining with\u00a0Harvard, which are worth a reported $100 million. The latest moves come after Harvard a set of demands issued by the Trump administration's Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism \"The whole instability or uncertainty is quite damaging,\" said Jiang, who has a student visa and would consider transferring across the country to Stanford University, where he is pursuing a dual degree. \"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a Thursday.

On its website, the says, \"Harvard is committed to maintaining our ability to host our international students and scholars.\" Beaton predicts that by the time college applications are due this fall, the university and the federal government \"will come to a compromise.\" \"International students make up such a vital part of the undergraduate student population,\" said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review's editor-in-chief. Further, foreign students typically pay full tuition, which makes international enrollment an important source of revenue for Harvard and many colleges and universities in the U.S.,\u00a0according to Franek.

Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Section 199A deduction for , or QBI, is currently worth up to 20% of eligible revenue, with some limitations. Without action from Congress, the QBI deduction will expire after 2025. But the House Republicans' \" \" would make the provision permanent and expand the maximum tax break to 23% starting in 2026. The QBI deduction applies to so-called pass-through businesses, which report profits or losses on individual tax returns. This includes partnerships and S-corporations, along with some trusts and estates. Sole proprietors, such as freelance, contract and gig economy workers, also qualify. For 2025, the tax break starts to phase-out when taxable income reaches $197,300 for single filers and $394,600 for married taxpayers filing jointly. The deduction can be reduced or eliminated completely, depending on your earnings and type of business (more on that below). For tax year 2022, the most recent data available, there were roughly , up from 18.7 million in 2018, the first year of the tax break, according to IRS data. However, the deduction has been controversial because \"most of the benefits flow to taxpayers with a lot of income,\" said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy with the Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy. \"These are not taxpayers who work a W-2 job and earn a salary,\" she said. \"They're business owners who receive business profits on their individual tax returns.\" Currently, certain white-collar professionals \u2014 doctors, lawyers, accountants, financial advisors and others \u2014 known as a \"specified service trade or business,\" or SSTB, can't claim the QBI deduction once income exceeds certain limits. There's also an income phase-out for non-SSTB businesses, but that doesn't go to zero. The House bill would change the phase-out calculation, which could provide a bigger tax break for certain SSTB owners, said certified financial planner and enrolled agent Ben Henry-Moreland, senior financial planning nerd for advisor platform Kitces.com, who last week. If enacted, the higher 23% deduction could offer \"some [tax] benefit\" for all income levels, but the phaseout changes would primarily benefit higher-income SSTB owners, he said.

It\u2019s unclear how the president\u2019s plan might work, and there would be associated with redirecting federal funding.

In an interview on CNBC Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said, \u201cthe paradigm, looking at education, is shifting.\u201d \u201cMore adults, who are looking to upskill, are looking at different programs \u2014 two-year or short-term programs,\u201d McMahon said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cWe believe there are other ways to train people to make a good living for their families in this country, and maybe not go into the debt of four-year universities.\u201d  and ballooning have played a large role in changing views about the higher education system. Overall, college enrollment is still climbing, but largely driven by gains at community colleges as more students choose shorter-term credentials at a lower cost. Undergraduate enrollment increased across the major institutional sectors this spring. However, community colleges notched the largest uptick, rising 5% year over year, according to a recent report by the . Undergraduate certificate program enrollment also jumped from a year ago, and is now up 20% since 2020. \u201cThis is great news for community colleges, and especially for those with strong vocational programs,\u201d said Doug Shapiro, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center\u2019s executive director. \u201cFour-year colleges can also feel good about higher numbers of undergraduates this spring, but their growth rates are slower.\u201d Increasingly,\u00a0high school students\u00a0are questioning is worth it. Roughly 42% of high school students say they are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are planning to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or\u00a0in-state public school, according to a separate survey\u00a0of 1,000 seniors, juniors and sophomores by the . That\u2019s up from 37% last year. A\u00a0shortage of , due to experienced workers aging out of the field, is also boosting the number of job opportunities and pay in those roles. \u201cCareer programs at community colleges provide students with accessible, affordable and accredited credentials and certificates that lead to jobs in their local communities and in the global economy,\u201d said Walter Bumphus, president and CEO of the American Association of Community Colleges. \u201cIn President Trump\u2019s first term we were able to partner with the U.S. Department of Labor to increase the number of apprenticeship programs and services across the nation, garnering 22,000 registered apprentices across 633 occupations, illustrating what is possible when we harness the power of partnering with the nation\u2019s community colleges,\u201d Bumphus said in an email. However, as lower-income students increasingly choose to attend community colleges or career training programs, there may be consequences for their longer-term financial standing, other reports show. Attending college once provided a similar wage premium for students regardless of their parents\u2019 financial standing, but that\u2019s changed in recent years, according to a by the National Bureau of Economic Research. As \u201clower-income students have been disproportionately diverted into community and for-profit colleges,\u201d their return on investment has suffered, the report found: \u201cHigher-income students now derive greater average observational value from going to college than the lower-income students.\u201d In other words, despite efforts to improve college access, wealthier students, who are more likely to enroll in four-year schools, get a bigger payoff. Meanwhile, getting an Ivy League degree has a \u201cstatistically insignificant impact\u201d on future earnings, according to a 2023 by Harvard University-based nonpartisan, nonprofit research group Opportunity Insights based on admissions data from several private and public colleges. Even attending a college in the \u201cIvy-plus\u201d category \u2014 which typically\u00a0includes other top schools like Stanford University, Duke University, the University of Chicago and Massachusetts Institute of Technology rather than a highly selective public institution, has benefits, the report found.

Further, it increases students\u2019 chances of ultimately reaching the of the earnings distribution by 60%, the Opportunity Insights report found. \u201cHighly selective private colleges serve as gateways to the upper echelons of society,\u201d the group of Harvard and Brown University-based economists who authored the report said. \u201cBecause these colleges currently admit students from high-income families at substantially higher rates than students from lower-income families with comparable academic credentials, they perpetuate privilege.\u201d", "tags": ["Harvard University", "Vocational education", "Politics", "Breaking News: Politics", "Careers", "Higher education", "Investment strategy", "Breaking News: Investing", "Donald Trump", "Donald J.
