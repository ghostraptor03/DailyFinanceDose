If you use Scrapy 2.13 or higher only, replace start_requests() with start(); note that start() is a coroutine (async def). If you need to maintain compatibility with lower Scrapy versions, when overriding start_requests() in a spider class, override start() as well; you can use super() to reuse the inherited start() implementation without copy-pasting.

2025-06-08 18:00:54 [scrapy.core.scraper] WARNING: Dropped: Non-financial: Trump tariffs would still ‘pinch’ consumers even if trade court block holds, economist says
{'article_id': '117f20a9f707f2c2e6db51d9e2b0364d',
 'author': '',
 'content': 'The fate of many of President Trump’s tariffs after a string of '
            'court rulings this week. But even if a court block on '
            'country-specific tariffs is upheld, others that would remain on '
            'the books — for products like steel and automobiles — are still '
            'expected to almost $1,000 a year, according to a by the Yale '
            'Budget Lab. “It does pinch” consumers’ wallets, said Ernie '
            'Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former '
            'chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers '
            'during the Biden administration. Tariffs are a tax paid on '
            'imports, paid by U.S. entities importing the good. Businesses are '
            'expected to pass on at least some of those costs to consumers. '
            'However, the dollar impact of those remaining tariffs is “a far '
            'cry” from what it would be if the country-specific tariffs were '
            'to remain, he said. The U.S. Court of International Trade on '
            'Wednesday blocked country-specific tariffs, including a 10% '
            'baseline tariff on most nations and separate levies on Canada, '
            'Mexico and China tied to allegations of fentanyl trafficking. A '
            'three-judge panel found Trump exceeded his authority by invoking '
            'the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those '
            'import duties. An appeals court the order on Thursday as it '
            'reviews the case. However, 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, '
            'automobiles and auto parts are still in place, with some '
            'carve-outs, as well as certain tariffs on China imposed during '
            'Trump’s first term and expanded during the Biden administration, '
            'Jennifer McKeown and Stephen Brown, economists at Capital '
            'Economists, wrote in a note Thursday. Those tariffs were imposed '
            'using different legal authorities. If the lower court’s order '
            'holds, those remaining tariffs would cost the average household '
            '$950 of purchasing power in 2025, according to the Yale Budget '
            'Lab published Thursday. That amounts to a 0.6% increase in '
            'consumer prices, it found. Another way consumers can view this '
            'legal development: The initial court ruling, if upheld, would '
            'save households more than $1,800 this year, said Tedeschi. That’s '
            'because the average household would lose in 2025 if the '
            'country-specific tariffs were to stay on the books, Tedeschi '
            'said. In that case, consumer prices would rise about 1.7% this '
            'year, he said. McKeown and Brown estimate the court ruling would '
            'lower the effective tariff rate to 6.5% from 15%. It was 2.5% at '
            'the start of the year, they said. “The most direct impact” of the '
            'remaining tariffs will be on car buying, Tedeschi said. Car '
            'prices would likely rise about 8% this year and 5% over the '
            'longer term, he said. But steel and aluminum are inputs in a '
            'swath of consumer products, from homebuilding to household '
            'appliances. The Supreme Court may be the final arbiter for '
            'Trump’s country-specific tariffs, a process that may take “many '
            'months,” according to McKeown and Brown. Additionally, “it would '
            'be unlikely to mark the end of the tariff war given the various '
            'other routes through which the Trump administration could impose '
            'tariffs,” they wrote. The Trump administration has also signaled '
            'an intent to put duties on additional products like '
            'pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper and lumber. Yesterday’s '
            'court decision was a “landmark ruling,” Tedeschi said. “I don’t '
            'expect it’ll be the end of things.”',

2025-06-08 18:06:06 [scrapy.core.scraper] WARNING: Dropped: Duplicate: ‘Maycember’ is almost over — here’s how to recover financially after a string of end-of-school-year activities
{'article_id': 'f88f56c17c069b7a99ad087a64c1932b',
 'author': '',
 'content': 'It’s officially “ ” a term making the rounds on social media to '
            'sum up the chaos and high costs of May — which mimic those of '
            'December, minus the . Although May is typically a month of '
            'endings and new beginnings, and social pressure have helped drive '
            'up the prices for many of the expenses that fall within its 31 '
            'days. From graduation gifts and prom attire to camp payments, '
            'dance recitals and sports tournaments, the gauntlet of events has '
            'left parents feeling particularly strained. “May often feels like '
            'a second December because so many expenses pile up at once,” said '
            'Isabel Barrow, executive director of financial planning at '
            'Edelman Financial Engines. “Graduations, school events, weddings '
            'and summer travel plans all converge, creating a storm of '
            'financial stress.” Here’s a look at other stories affecting the '
            'financial advisor business. The key is not to panic, Barrow said. '
            '“It’s important to remember that a long-term plan requires '
            'long-term perspective, and one month of overspending doesn’t have '
            'to derail your financial goals.” Most financial experts recommend '
            'going back to a basic .\xa0“The first step towards recovery is to '
            'take the time to review your spending and reassess your financial '
            'plan,” Barrow said. “Financial well-being begins with awareness '
            'and the feeling that you are regaining control.” If you’ve racked '
            'up , start addressing that immediately, Barrow said. To stay '
            'motivated, try picking a , such as the avalanche method or the '
            'snowball method, which respectively prioritize paying off the '
            'highest-interest debt first or paying off your debt from smallest '
            'to largest balance. At the same time, automating your is one of '
            'the best ways to rebuild after a heavy spending period, Barrow '
            'said: “Set up a recurring transfer to your emergency fund or '
            'savings account.” If your employer offers direct deposit '
            'splitting, use that to route a portion of your paycheck directly '
            'into savings, she advised. The start of summer is also a good '
            'time to scale back, according to certified financial planner '
            'Lazetta Rainey Braxton, founder and managing principal of the '
            'Real Wealth Coterie. Pack a picnic lunch for a day at the park, '
            'or “find free events such as museum days and public events.” '
            'There may also be more opportunities to pick up a side gig this '
            'time of year, she added, such as babysitting or tutoring over the '
            'long break from school. Those funds can help turbocharge debt '
            'repayment. “Know that Maycember is a stretch month that doesn’t '
            'represent the pace of your entire life,” said Braxton, who is a '
            'member of CNBC’s . “Use your experience as a guide with a '
            'rearview mirror.” Tally what you’ve spent on activities and '
            'celebrations such as Mother’s Day, graduations and vacations, as '
            'well as any payments towards camps or summer activities. Use that '
            'total to make a plan for next year, she advised. “Start a '
            'Maycember fund by creating a separate savings account and setting '
            'aside $25 a month or more,” she said. That advance planning can '
            'also come in handy to make the most of sales holidays later in '
            'the year, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, she added. '
            'Still, “It’s important to remember that you don’t need to '
            'overspend or go beyond your budget to give meaningful gifts,” '
            'cautioned Kelli Smith, a director of financial planning at '
            'Edelman Financial Engines. “Thoughtfulness and creativity can '
            'make a big impact.”',

2025-06-08 18:06:51 [scrapy.core.scraper] WARNING: Dropped: Non-financial: Trump tariffs would still 'pinch' consumers even if trade court block holds, economist says
{'article_id': 'd0a13fd219b462727f6c71c47d8c5768',
 'author': '',
 'content': "The fate of many of President Trump's tariffs after a string of "
            'court rulings this week. But even if a court block on '
            'country-specific tariffs is upheld, others that would remain on '
            'the books — for products like steel and automobiles — are still '
            'expected to almost $1,000 a year, according to a by the Yale '
            'Budget Lab. "It does pinch" consumers\' wallets, said Ernie '
            'Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former '
            'chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers '
            'during the Biden administration. Tariffs are a tax paid on '
            'imports, paid by U.S. entities importing the good. Businesses are '
            'expected to pass on at least some of those costs to consumers. '
            'However, the dollar impact of those remaining tariffs is "a far '
            'cry" from what it would be if the country-specific tariffs were '
            'to remain, he said. The U.S. Court of International Trade on '
            'Wednesday blocked country-specific tariffs, including a 10% '
            'baseline tariff on most nations and separate levies on Canada, '
            'Mexico and China tied to allegations of fentanyl trafficking. A '
            'three-judge panel found Trump exceeded his authority by invoking '
            'the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those '
            'import duties. An appeals court the order on Thursday as it '
            'reviews the case. However, 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, '
            'automobiles and auto parts are still in place, with some '
            'carve-outs, as well as certain tariffs on China imposed during '
            "Trump's first term and expanded during the Biden administration, "
            'Jennifer McKeown and Stephen Brown, economists at Capital '
            'Economists, wrote in a note Thursday. Those tariffs were imposed '
            "using different legal authorities. If the lower court's order "
            'holds, those remaining tariffs would cost the average household '
            '$950 of purchasing power in 2025, according to the Yale Budget '
            'Lab published Thursday. That amounts to a 0.6% increase in '
            'consumer prices, it found. Another way consumers can view this '
            'legal development: The initial court ruling, if upheld, would '
            "save households more than $1,800 this year, said Tedeschi. That's "
            'because the average household would lose in 2025 if the '
            'country-specific tariffs were to stay on the books, Tedeschi '
            'said. In that case, consumer prices would rise about 1.7% this '
            'year, he said. McKeown and Brown estimate the court ruling would '
            'lower the effective tariff rate to 6.5% from 15%. It was 2.5% at '
            'the start of the year, they said. "The most direct impact" of the '
            'remaining tariffs will be on car buying, Tedeschi said. Car '
            'prices would likely rise about 8% this year and 5% over the '
            'longer term, he said. But steel and aluminum are inputs in a '
            'swath of consumer products, from homebuilding to household '
            'appliances. The Supreme Court may be the final arbiter for '
            'Trump\'s country-specific tariffs, a process that may take "many '
            'months," according to McKeown and Brown. Additionally, "it would '
            'be unlikely to mark the end of the tariff war given the various '
            'other routes through which the Trump administration could impose '
            'tariffs," they wrote. The Trump administration has also signaled '
            'an intent to put duties on additional products like '
            "pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper and lumber. Yesterday's "
            'court decision was a "landmark ruling," Tedeschi said. "I don\'t '
            'expect it\'ll be the end of things."',
