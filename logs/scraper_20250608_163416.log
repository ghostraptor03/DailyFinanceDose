If you use Scrapy 2.13 or higher only, replace start_requests() with start(); note that start() is a coroutine (async def).

 'content': 'In this article The more worries, the better his bank seems to '
            'do. As has grown larger, more profitable and increasingly more '
            'crucial to the U.S. economy in recent years, its star CEO has '
            'grown more vocal about what could go wrong — all while things '
            'keep going right for his bank. In the best of times and in the '
            'worst of times, Dimon’s public outlook is grim. Whether it’s his '
            '2022 forecast for a “ ” hitting the U.S. economy, his concerns '
            'over the fraying post-World War II world order or his about '
            'America getting hit by a one-two punch of recession and '
            'inflation, Dimon seems to lace every earnings report, TV '
            'appearance and investor event with another dire warning. “His '
            'track record of leading the bank is incredible,” said , a board '
            'member of four banks and investor through his firm Strategic '
            'Value Bank Partner. “His track record of making economic-calamity '
            'predictions, not as good.” Over his two decades running JPMorgan, '
            'Dimon, 69, has helped build a financial institution unlike any '
            'the world has seen. A sprawling giant in both Main Street banking '
            'and Wall Street high finance, Dimon’s bank is, in his own words, '
            'an end-game when it comes to money. It has more branches, '
            'deposits and online users than any peer and is a leading credit '
            'card and small business franchise. It has a top market share in '
            'both trading and investment banking, and more than $10 trillion '
            'moves over its global payment rails daily. A review of 20 years '
            'of Dimon’s annual investor and his public statements show a '
            'distinct evolution. He became CEO in 2006, and his first decade '
            'at the helm of JPMorgan was consumed by the U.S. housing bubble, '
            'the 2008 financial crisis and its long aftermath, including the '
            'acquisition of two failed rivals, and Washington Mutual. By the '
            'time he began his second decade leading JPMorgan, however, just '
            'as the legal hangover from the mortgage crisis began to fade, '
            'Dimon began seeing new storm clouds on the horizon. “There will '
            'be another crisis,” he wrote in his April 2015 CEO , musing on '
            'potential triggers and pointing out that recent gyrations in U.S. '
            'debt were a “warning shot” for markets. That passage marked the '
            'start of more frequent financial warnings from Dimon, including '
            'worries of a recession — which didn’t happen until the 2020 '
            'pandemic triggered a — as well as concerns around market '
            'meltdowns and the ballooning U.S. deficit. But it also marked a '
            'decade in which JPMorgan’s performance began lapping rivals. '
            'After leveling out at roughly $20 billion in annual profit for a '
            'few years, the sprawling machine that Dimon oversaw began to '
            'truly hit its stride. JPMorgan generated seven record annual '
            'profits from 2015 to 2024, over twice as many as in Dimon’s first '
            'decade as CEO. In that time, investors began aggressively bidding '
            'up JPMorgan’s shares, buying into the idea that it was a growth '
            'company in an otherwise boring sector. JPMorgan is now the '
            'world’s most valuable publicly traded financial firm and is '
            'spending $18 billion annually on technology, including , to stay '
            'that way. While Dimon seems perpetually worried about the economy '
            'and rising geopolitical turmoil, the U.S. keeps chugging along. '
            'That means unemployment and consumer spending has been more '
            'resilient than expected, allowing JPMorgan to churn out record '
            'profits. In 2022, Dimon told a roomful of professional investors '
            'to prepare for an economic storm: “Right now, it’s kind of sunny, '
            'things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,” '
            'Dimon said, referring to the Federal Reserve managing the '
            'post-pandemic economy. “That is right out there, down the road, '
            'coming our way,” he said. “This may be the most dangerous time '
            'the world has seen in decades,” Dimon said the following year in '
            'an earnings . But investors who listened to Dimon and made their '
            'portfolios more conservative would have missed out on the best '
            'two-year run for the in decades. “It’s an interesting '
            'contradiction, no doubt,” Mackovak said about Dimon’s downbeat '
            'remarks and his bank’s performance. “Part of it could just be the '
            'brand-building of Jamie Dimon,” the investor said. “Or having a '
            'win-win narrative where if something goes bad, you can say, ‘Oh, '
            'I called it,’ and if doesn’t, well your bank’s still chugging '
            'along.” According to the former president of a top five U.S. '
            'financial institution, bankers know that it’s wiser to broadcast '
            'caution than optimism. Former CEO Chuck Prince, for example, is '
            'best known for his ill-fated 2007 comment about the mortgage '
            'business that “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to .” '
            '“One learns that there’s a lot more downside to your reputation '
            'if you are overly optimistic and things go wrong,” said the '
            'former president, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss Dimon. '
            '“It’s damaging to your bank, and you look stupid, whereas the '
            'other way around, you just look like you’re being a very '
            'cautious, thoughtful banker.” Banking is ultimately a business of '
            'calculated risks, and its CEOs have to be attuned to the '
            'downside, to the possibility that they don’t get repaid on their '
            'loans, said banking analyst Mike Mayo of . “It’s the old cliche '
            'that a good banker carries an umbrella when the sun is shining; '
            'they’re always looking around the corner, always aware of what '
            'could go wrong,” Mayo said. But other longtime Dimon watchers see '
            'something else. Dimon has an “ulterior motive” for his public '
            'comments, according to Portales Partners analyst “I think this '
            'rhetoric is to keep his management team focused on future risks, '
            'whether they happen or not,” Peabody said. “With a '
            'high-performing, high-growth franchise, he’s trying to prevent '
            'them from becoming complacent, so I think he’s ingrained in their '
            'culture a constant war room-type atmosphere.” Dimon has no '
            'shortage of things to worry about these days, despite the fact '
            'that his bank generated a record $58.5 billion in profit last '
            'year. Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza rage on, the U.S. national '
            'debt grows, and President ’s trade policies continue to jolt '
            'adversaries and allies alike. “It’s fair to observe that he’s not '
            'omniscient and not everything he says comes true,” said Truist '
            'bank analyst . “He comes at it more from a perspective that you '

{'author': '',
 'content': 'In this article The more worries, the better his bank seems to '
            'do. As has grown larger, more profitable and increasingly more '
            'crucial to the U.S. economy in recent years, its star CEO has '
            'grown more vocal about what could go wrong — all while things '
            'keep going right for his bank. In the best of times and in the '
            'worst of times, Dimon’s public outlook is grim. Whether it’s his '
            '2022 forecast for a “ ” hitting the U.S. economy, his concerns '
            'over the fraying post-World War II world order or his about '
            'America getting hit by a one-two punch of recession and '
            'inflation, Dimon seems to lace every earnings report, TV '
            'appearance and investor event with another dire warning. “His '
            'track record of leading the bank is incredible,” said , a board '
            'member of four banks and investor through his firm Strategic '
            'Value Bank Partner. “His track record of making economic-calamity '
            'predictions, not as good.” Over his two decades running JPMorgan, '
            'Dimon, 69, has helped build a financial institution unlike any '
            'the world has seen. A sprawling giant in both Main Street banking '
            'and Wall Street high finance, Dimon’s bank is, in his own words, '
            'an end-game when it comes to money. It has more branches, '
            'deposits and online users than any peer and is a leading credit '
            'card and small business franchise. It has a top market share in '
            'both trading and investment banking, and more than $10 trillion '
            'moves over its global payment rails daily. A review of 20 years '
            'of Dimon’s annual investor and his public statements show a '
            'distinct evolution. He became CEO in 2006, and his first decade '
            'at the helm of JPMorgan was consumed by the U.S. housing bubble, '
            'the 2008 financial crisis and its long aftermath, including the '
            'acquisition of two failed rivals, and Washington Mutual. By the '
            'time he began his second decade leading JPMorgan, however, just '
            'as the legal hangover from the mortgage crisis began to fade, '
            'Dimon began seeing new storm clouds on the horizon. “There will '
            'be another crisis,” he wrote in his April 2015 CEO , musing on '
            'potential triggers and pointing out that recent gyrations in U.S. '
            'debt were a “warning shot” for markets. That passage marked the '
            'start of more frequent financial warnings from Dimon, including '
            'worries of a recession — which didn’t happen until the 2020 '
            'pandemic triggered a — as well as concerns around market '
            'meltdowns and the ballooning U.S. deficit. But it also marked a '
            'decade in which JPMorgan’s performance began lapping rivals. '
            'After leveling out at roughly $20 billion in annual profit for a '
            'few years, the sprawling machine that Dimon oversaw began to '
            'truly hit its stride. JPMorgan generated seven record annual '
            'profits from 2015 to 2024, over twice as many as in Dimon’s first '
            'decade as CEO. In that time, investors began aggressively bidding '
            'up JPMorgan’s shares, buying into the idea that it was a growth '
            'company in an otherwise boring sector. JPMorgan is now the '
            'world’s most valuable publicly traded financial firm and is '
            'spending $18 billion annually on technology, including , to stay '
            'that way. While Dimon seems perpetually worried about the economy '
            'and rising geopolitical turmoil, the U.S. keeps chugging along. '
            'That means unemployment and consumer spending has been more '
            'resilient than expected, allowing JPMorgan to churn out record '
            'profits. In 2022, Dimon told a roomful of professional investors '
            'to prepare for an economic storm: “Right now, it’s kind of sunny, '
            'things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,” '
            'Dimon said, referring to the Federal Reserve managing the '
            'post-pandemic economy. “That is right out there, down the road, '
            'coming our way,” he said. “This may be the most dangerous time '
            'the world has seen in decades,” Dimon said the following year in '
            'an earnings . But investors who listened to Dimon and made their '
            'portfolios more conservative would have missed out on the best '
            'two-year run for the in decades. “It’s an interesting '
            'contradiction, no doubt,” Mackovak said about Dimon’s downbeat '
            'remarks and his bank’s performance. “Part of it could just be the '
            'brand-building of Jamie Dimon,” the investor said. “Or having a '
            'win-win narrative where if something goes bad, you can say, ‘Oh, '
            'I called it,’ and if doesn’t, well your bank’s still chugging '
            'along.” According to the former president of a top five U.S. '
            'financial institution, bankers know that it’s wiser to broadcast '
            'caution than optimism. Former CEO Chuck Prince, for example, is '
            'best known for his ill-fated 2007 comment about the mortgage '
            'business that “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to .” '
            '“One learns that there’s a lot more downside to your reputation '
            'if you are overly optimistic and things go wrong,” said the '
            'former president, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss Dimon. '
            '“It’s damaging to your bank, and you look stupid, whereas the '
            'other way around, you just look like you’re being a very '
            'cautious, thoughtful banker.” Banking is ultimately a business of '
            'calculated risks, and its CEOs have to be attuned to the '
            'downside, to the possibility that they don’t get repaid on their '
            'loans, said banking analyst Mike Mayo of . “It’s the old cliche '
            'that a good banker carries an umbrella when the sun is shining; '
            'they’re always looking around the corner, always aware of what '
            'could go wrong,” Mayo said. But other longtime Dimon watchers see '
            'something else. Dimon has an “ulterior motive” for his public '
            'comments, according to Portales Partners analyst “I think this '
            'rhetoric is to keep his management team focused on future risks, '
            'whether they happen or not,” Peabody said. “With a '
            'high-performing, high-growth franchise, he’s trying to prevent '
            'them from becoming complacent, so I think he’s ingrained in their '
            'culture a constant war room-type atmosphere.” Dimon has no '
            'shortage of things to worry about these days, despite the fact '
            'that his bank generated a record $58.5 billion in profit last '
            'year. Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza rage on, the U.S. national '
            'debt grows, and President ’s trade policies continue to jolt '
            'adversaries and allies alike. “It’s fair to observe that he’s not '
            'omniscient and not everything he says comes true,” said Truist '
            'bank analyst . “He comes at it more from a perspective that you '
            'need to be prepared for X, as opposed to we’re convinced X is '
            'going to happen.” JPMorgan was better positioned for higher '
            'interest rates than most of its peers were in 2023, when rates '
            'surged and punished those who held low-yielding long-term bonds, '
            'Foran noted. “For many years, he said, ’Be prepared for the '
            '10-year at 5%, and we all thought he was crazy, because it was '
            'like 1% at the time,” Foran said. “Turns out that being prepared '
            'was not a bad thing.” Perhaps the best explanation for Dimon’s '
            'dour outlook is that, no matter how big and powerful JPMorgan is, '
            'financial companies can be fragile. The history of finance is one '
