2025-06-08 17:22:14 [scrapy.core.scraper] WARNING: Dropped: Duplicate: Court order challenges Trump’s plan to move federal student loans to Small Business Administration
{'article_id': 'ce94f49e9915b2216c26d490a1527505',
 'author': '',
 'content': 'A federal judge’s recent order may foil  the country’s from the '
            'U.S. Department of Education to the . Judge Myong J. Joun of U.S. '
            'District Court for the District of Massachusetts in his May 22 '
            'preliminary injunction that the Trump administration was required '
            'to reinstate more than 1,300 Education Department employees and '
            'was blocked from carrying out Trump’s directive “to transfer '
            'management of federal student loans and special education '
            'functions out of the Department.” In other words, federal student '
            'loans will stay with the Department of Education, for now. Trump '
            'had announced on March 21 a plan to transfer more than 40 million '
            'student loan accounts to the SBA. “They’re all set for it,” the '
            'president said of the SBA at the time. “They’re waiting for it.” '
            'Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at '
            'the Education Department, slammed the judge’s decision. “Once '
            'again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his '
            'authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and '
            'issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make '
            'the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the '
            'American people,” Biedermann wrote in a statement to CNBC on '
            'Thursday. The Trump administration the order be stayed pending an '
            'appeal of the decision. The development that student loans will '
            'remain in the Education Dept. for now is good news for borrowers, '
            'said Sarah Sattelmeyer, a project director at New America and '
            'senior advisor under the Biden administration. “Instead of '
            'increasing efficiency, the movement of the Department’s core '
            'functions would have increased confusion and decreased the '
            'effectiveness of programs that students depend on to access '
            'education,” Sattelmeyer said. Consumer advocates are worried that '
            'a mass transfer of accounts between federal agencies could '
            'trigger errors, or compromise federal student loan borrowers’ '
            'privacy. Those problems have occurred during much smaller '
            'transfers between loan servicers. Advocates also raise concerns '
            'about how a change in agency might affect borrower protections '
            'and programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Small '
            'Business Administration has no experience relevant to the '
            'management of federal student loans, said higher education expert '
            'Mark Kantrowitz. It would ultimately require an act of Congress '
            'to move the loan portfolio to the SBA, Kantrowitz said. The '
            'Higher Education Act of 1965 spells out that the Education '
            'Department’s Federal Student Aid office is responsible for the '
            'debt, he said. Adding to advocates’ criticism over Trump’s '
            'proposed transfer was his administration’s in March that the '
            'SBA’s workforce would be reduced by 43% — leaving fewer people to '
            'manage this new responsibility.',

2025-06-08 17:24:19 [scrapy.core.scraper] WARNING: Dropped: Non-financial: Trump tariffs would still ‘pinch’ consumers even if trade court block holds, economist says
{'article_id': '117f20a9f707f2c2e6db51d9e2b0364d',
 'author': '',
 'content': 'The fate of many of President Trump’s tariffs after a string of '
            'court rulings this week. But even if a court block on '
            'country-specific tariffs is upheld, others that would remain on '
            'the books — for products like steel and automobiles — are still '
            'expected to almost $1,000 a year, according to a by the Yale '
            'Budget Lab. “It does pinch” consumers’ wallets, said Ernie '
            'Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former '
            'chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers '
            'during the Biden administration. Tariffs are a tax paid on '
            'imports, paid by U.S. entities importing the good. Businesses are '
            'expected to pass on at least some of those costs to consumers. '
            'However, the dollar impact of those remaining tariffs is “a far '
            'cry” from what it would be if the country-specific tariffs were '
            'to remain, he said. The U.S. Court of International Trade on '
            'Wednesday blocked country-specific tariffs, including a 10% '
            'baseline tariff on most nations and separate levies on Canada, '
            'Mexico and China tied to allegations of fentanyl trafficking. A '
            'three-judge panel found Trump exceeded his authority by invoking '
            'the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those '
            'import duties. An appeals court the order on Thursday as it '
            'reviews the case. However, 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, '
            'automobiles and auto parts are still in place, with some '
            'carve-outs, as well as certain tariffs on China imposed during '
            'Trump’s first term and expanded during the Biden administration, '
            'Jennifer McKeown and Stephen Brown, economists at Capital '
            'Economists, wrote in a note Thursday. Those tariffs were imposed '
            'using different legal authorities. If the lower court’s order '
            'holds, those remaining tariffs would cost the average household '
            '$950 of purchasing power in 2025, according to the Yale Budget '
            'Lab published Thursday. That amounts to a 0.6% increase in '
            'consumer prices, it found. Another way consumers can view this '
            'legal development: The initial court ruling, if upheld, would '
            'save households more than $1,800 this year, said Tedeschi. That’s '
            'because the average household would lose in 2025 if the '
            'country-specific tariffs were to stay on the books, Tedeschi '
            'said. In that case, consumer prices would rise about 1.7% this '
            'year, he said. McKeown and Brown estimate the court ruling would '
            'lower the effective tariff rate to 6.5% from 15%. It was 2.5% at '
            'the start of the year, they said. “The most direct impact” of the '
            'remaining tariffs will be on car buying, Tedeschi said. Car '
            'prices would likely rise about 8% this year and 5% over the '
            'longer term, he said. But steel and aluminum are inputs in a '
            'swath of consumer products, from homebuilding to household '
            'appliances. The Supreme Court may be the final arbiter for '
            'Trump’s country-specific tariffs, a process that may take “many '
            'months,” according to McKeown and Brown. Additionally, “it would '
            'be unlikely to mark the end of the tariff war given the various '
            'other routes through which the Trump administration could impose '
            'tariffs,” they wrote. The Trump administration has also signaled '
            'an intent to put duties on additional products like '
            'pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper and lumber. Yesterday’s '
            'court decision was a “landmark ruling,” Tedeschi said. “I don’t '
            'expect it’ll be the end of things.”',

 'content': 'The fate of many of President Trump’s tariffs after a string of '
            'court rulings this week. But even if a court block on '
            'country-specific tariffs is upheld, others that would remain on '
            'the books — for products like steel and automobiles — are still '
            'expected to almost $1,000 a year, according to a by the Yale '
            'Budget Lab. “It does pinch” consumers’ wallets, said Ernie '
            'Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former '
            'chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers '
            'during the Biden administration. Tariffs are a tax paid on '
            'imports, paid by U.S. entities importing the good. Businesses are '
            'expected to pass on at least some of those costs to consumers. '
            'However, the dollar impact of those remaining tariffs is “a far '
            'cry” from what it would be if the country-specific tariffs were '
            'to remain, he said. The U.S. Court of International Trade on '
            'Wednesday blocked country-specific tariffs, including a 10% '
            'baseline tariff on most nations and separate levies on Canada, '
            'Mexico and China tied to allegations of fentanyl trafficking. A '
            'three-judge panel found Trump exceeded his authority by invoking '
            'the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those '
            'import duties. An appeals court the order on Thursday as it '
            'reviews the case. However, 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, '
            'automobiles and auto parts are still in place, with some '
            'carve-outs, as well as certain tariffs on China imposed during '
            'Trump’s first term and expanded during the Biden administration, '
            'Jennifer McKeown and Stephen Brown, economists at Capital '
            'Economists, wrote in a note Thursday. Those tariffs were imposed '
            'using different legal authorities. If the lower court’s order '
            'holds, those remaining tariffs would cost the average household '
            '$950 of purchasing power in 2025, according to the Yale Budget '
            'Lab published Thursday. That amounts to a 0.6% increase in '
            'consumer prices, it found. Another way consumers can view this '
            'legal development: The initial court ruling, if upheld, would '
            'save households more than $1,800 this year, said Tedeschi. That’s '
            'because the average household would lose in 2025 if the '
            'country-specific tariffs were to stay on the books, Tedeschi '
            'said. In that case, consumer prices would rise about 1.7% this '
            'year, he said. McKeown and Brown estimate the court ruling would '
            'lower the effective tariff rate to 6.5% from 15%. It was 2.5% at '
            'the start of the year, they said. “The most direct impact” of the '
            'remaining tariffs will be on car buying, Tedeschi said. Car '
            'prices would likely rise about 8% this year and 5% over the '
            'longer term, he said. But steel and aluminum are inputs in a '
            'swath of consumer products, from homebuilding to household '
            'appliances. The Supreme Court may be the final arbiter for '
            'Trump’s country-specific tariffs, a process that may take “many '
            'months,” according to McKeown and Brown. Additionally, “it would '
            'be unlikely to mark the end of the tariff war given the various '
            'other routes through which the Trump administration could impose '
            'tariffs,” they wrote. The Trump administration has also signaled '
            'an intent to put duties on additional products like '
            'pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper and lumber. Yesterday’s '
            'court decision was a “landmark ruling,” Tedeschi said. “I don’t '
            'expect it’ll be the end of things.”',
